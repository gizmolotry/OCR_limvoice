      "chunk_text": "The Final Goal. \nTHE M6ondharrig \"Gaels,\" besides being peerless athletes \nwere also, as was fitting, sincere and devout members of t~e \nancient church. Without exception they were to be found m \ntheir places at Mass every Sunday of the ~e~1·, and ~hey were \nas regular in attending to their oth?r rehg10us duties. The \nfaith in them was strong and practical and kept them free \nfrom the dangers to which young men are exposed who have \nnot the support of earnest spiritual conviction. \nNoble specimens of manhood, indeed, were the _Gaels-:­\nmodern Sir Galahads in the purity of their morals-m thetr \nhorror of lewd speech or action. One might be in their com­\npany for years, yet never hear a prof~ne or_ a loose word. \nIn the standing records of athletic achievement the names \nof champions of the Gaelic Athletic Association of Ireland­\nthe modern \"Gaels \"-are emblazoned high and frequent. \nHas not this rectitude of life, this respect for their strong, \nyoung bodies-the \"temples of the H_oly Ghost \"-?1uch to do \nwith placing these natural and untramed at~letes m the fore­\nfront of the world's physical prowess and achievement? \nIn Moondharri(J' the Gaels were encouraged and supported \nby their parish prie~t, who saw that exercise an~ ~mulation \nwere good for them physically and mentally, givi~g them \nbesides an interest and a pride in their country, which ~ept \nthem from being swept away in the ruinous torrent of emigra-\ntion. \n. The love which the Gaels gave in return to the~r belo~ed \npastor was deep and resistless as their own noble Suir at high \ntide. . \n'.}'he younger curate, Father John Dermody, had _a still \nstron(J'er claim on their affections. Had he not been m the \ndays before his ordination-a time all of them could remem­\nber-one of themselves, an athlete and a Gael? Not ten year!! \nTHE FINAL GOAL. 117 \nback he had played with Tullagmore, their greatest rivals, in \na memorable struggle against Moondharrig, when the latter \nhad to bow to defeat \nOftentimes, even now, he would come into the practice \nfield, and borrowing a caman give the ball a few strokes that \nwere a delight to see, such skill and nerve was in them. The \nCaptain himself could not do it neater or swifter. Many a time \nthe Gaels sighed as they thought what a tower of strength the \nyoung curate would be to them in the championship matches \nif it were not \"against the rules.\" It is to be presumed, too, \nthat Father John himself often wished he could lend a hand \nwhen the ball came rushing dangerously on the Moondharrig \ngoal. With all his training in self-control he was observed to \nwatch the games with intense interest, and to be elated or de­\npressed according to the varying fortunes of the contest. \nAt the time of which we write a great match for the \ncounty championship was impending between Moondharrig \nand Tullagmore. Great was the anxiety regarding the issue, \nfor that was to decide which of the two grM,t teams would \nhave the honour of entering the provincial contests. For the \nfirst time for years Father John found his sympathies divided. \nHe would like to see his native parish, Tullagmore, a winner; \nand on the other hand he shrank from the thought of seeing \nMoondharrig, which he had come to love, suffer the bitterness \nof defeat. \nIt was a wild night in the month of March, and the young \ncurate was sitting up late over his books. The clock showed \nclose on midnight when he knelt down to say the beads before \nretiring. Outside a fearful storm howled and moaned in long \ndrawn gusts, and torrential rains swept the windows. \nSuddenly the door bell rang, sou.nding harshly in a lull \nof the storm. The young priest started up from his knees. It \ncould mean only one thing-a sick call, and terribly urgent it \nmust be to bring people out on such a night. \nThe call of duty always found Father John ready and \ncheerful ; yet he might be pardoned for feeling a certain sink­\ning of the heart at the prospect of a long journey in storm and \ndarkness. Lighting a small lantern kept for such occasions, he \nwent quickly down stairs and unbolted the front door. Two",

Often have you played together on the \nbawn, and your feet was as swift as the wolf-hounds, your eye \nsure, and your arm strong and skilled to strike the ball through \nthe posts, mo chroidhe. They'll miss you, Moran a, mhic, on \nthe hurling field, but your old father will miss you more than \nall! \n\"'Tis you that were the comfort of his life, and earned the \nbread for his eating. The horses heeded your voice in the \nploughing-field and the furrow you made was straight as a \nbeam of the rainy sun. The people passing stopped to admire \nthe straight, smooth-turned sods and to hear your cheery \ngreeting when you turned at the headland. They'll miss you \nfrom field and headland, but mo bh1·on, I'll miss you more \nthan all. \n\"Three nights ago a, mhic-mo chroide coming from Port­\nlaw Fair along the banks of the Suir, near the old castle of \nGurtheen I heard the Banshee cry aloud in the night. . \n\"Och a,nee ! but 'twas a bitter cry, and the flesh ofmy \nheart shook and the sweat came out on my brow with the woe \nand loneliness of it. Moran Dhilish I prayed to God's Son \nthat died for us that you might not be taken, but myself \ninstead, an old broken man. \n\"H 0 willed it otherwise~a.ye-but did He will it?\" Here \na terrible change came upon the affiicted father, a whirlwind \nof passion shook him, his face grew dark and scowling, his \nvoice loud and strident, so that many of the people fell away \nfrom him in terror. \n\"Ay did He will it? No! You were murdered, my \nnoble boy. They murdered you, the hounds of hell, the \nheartless Sassenach ! May the curse of a heart-broken father \nfall on the English dogs that tracked you to death.\" \nGoing on his knees by his son's grave the unhappy man \nnow poured forth the most awful maledictions on England, \nand the British government which he held responsible for his \nson'a death. As he poured forth these terrible imprecations a \nsort of silent a we fell on the crowd. No one stirred until at \nlast Dermot Roche approached and touching the old man on \nthe shoulder said quietly: \nTHE BURIAL OF MORAN OG. 107 \n\"•Tis time for the prayer now, sir, we have the grave \nfilled in.\" \nAt the touch O'Laughlin stood up and looked around him \nwildly, like one awakening from a horrible dream. \n\"The prayer\" he gasped. \"Of course-the prayer.\" Then \nina piteous cry'' Oh Moran, a 1nhic, my innocent boy, have I \nbeen cursing over your grave, you that never hurt man or \nbeast, that never had a bad word in your mouth? Forgive \nme, oh God, and you Moran down in the cold clay, forgive \nme-forgive-\" \nThe old man suddenly put his hand to his forehead, \nstaggered uncertain for a moment-tried again to speak, then \nwith a low, weak cry fell insensible into the strong arms of the \nCaptain of the Hurlers",

He w as coming home one night from the Fair \nof Waterford, and feeling very tired, lay down and fell fast \nasleep on the Fairy R rtth of Glen-na-sulish, of all the places \nin the world! The Good People that live under the Rath, find­\ning him there when they came out to their midnight revels, \nmust have put a heavy spell of their power on him, for when \nhe awoke he found himself in a strange country. \nIt was a very beautiful land his bewildered eyes looked \non. Noble forests and green pastures were there, and on th!;) \nhilltops stood lofty, battlemented castles, worthy to be the \nhomes of kings and chieftains. He looked in vain for a straw­\nroofed cottage or a potato-garden-there was absolutely noth­\ning to remind him of his beloved Moondharrig. \nThe bewilderment of our worthy Gael was indeed great. He \nscratched his head and looked about him with wide open-eyes. \n\" The divil's cure to me, anyway,\" he muttered ruefully \n\"for goin a-near Rory Gallaher's at all; maybe it was a drop \ntoo much I took, an' I remimber goin' asleep on the Rath, \nwhatever misfortune drove me there at all at all.\" \nHow long he might have continued to upbraid himself thus \nwe do not know, but suddenly there was a great crashing· in \nthe underbrush close by, and he had to step aside quickly as \na wild boar, hotly chased, tore past. In another second the \nhunter, running swiftly, came in view, but at sight of Meeha.l \nhe stopped short with every appes.rance of astonishment. \nMeehal-na-Gamawn observed that the stranger was tall and \nbeautifully formed, with hair in long, yellow ringlets falling \nto his waist. His apparel was close-fitting and becoming, and \nseemed to be of some sort of polished leather with clasps of gold. \nIn his right hand was a hunting spear, and in his left a \nsheaf of spears of the same pattern. \nMOONDHARRIG VERSUS TIR-NA-N-OG. 109 \nThere was nought of fierceness in his voice, but a sort of \nsurprise, 1is he inquired : \" How came you, mortal, into the \nLand of the Ever-Young ? \" \n\"That's what I'm thryin' to find out meself,\" answered \nI1foehal, not a whit abashed. \"Rory Galbher had something \nto do with id, an' the Glen-na-sulish fairies had more, but I'm \n:1s innocent of id meself as Pether Keefe's dog that always \nwint around pnrtindin' nothin, I'm Meehal O'Clery of M oond­\nharrig, and maybe if you'd declare yourself we 'd know each \nother better.\" \nThe stranger perceptibly straightened up as he replied \nwith some dignity. \n\"I am called Oisin, son of Finn, the son of Cumhal.\" \nMeohal-na-Gama wn put his hands in his breeches' pockets, \npursed his lips, and admitted a low whistle. \n\"I heard o' you before, Oisin,\" said he.\" I heard tell of you \nbefore Prince, as John L. Sullivan said to the Prince o' Wales.\" \nMeehal regarded the Fenian hero from head to feet with a \nglance that had almost as much admiration in it as that he \nusually bestowed on Dermot Roche, the captnin of the Moond­\nharrig hurlers. Then he proffered a hand-shake to the son of \nFinn. \" Put id there, Oisin\" said he, \" put id there if id \nweighed a ton, man dear; you used to be a little hard on St. \nPatrick (a better man than you or me), but you were a handy \nman in a fight, be all accounts, an' a good Irishman, pagau an' \nall as you were. 'Tis in heaven you'd be now man, an' not \ntearin' thro the woods like this, if you on'y had sinse an' list­\nened to the Saint.\" \n\"Tir-na-n-og is good enough for the son of Finn,\" answered \nOisin with a trace of sadness in his tone. \"Come with me, \nmortal, and see the goodly company of the F ouians.\" \nOisin, leading the way, in a short time came to what seemed \na large palace, and entering they found themselves in an imm­\nense hall. Along this stretched tables groaning beneath the \nmeats and good things set as for a great feast. Hundreds of \nwarriors, many of them clad in gold and brazenarmour,were seat­\ning themselves to eat. \nOisin did not hesitate, but going towards the head of one of \nthe tables found ,eats for himself and his companion , 'l'he",

The names of \nFinn McCumhal, Conall Gulban, Conan Maol, Goll MacMorna' \nand Oscar had been familiar to him from boyhood when \nhe had heard of their great deeds in many a folk-lore tale. \nThat he should see those heroes with his own eyes seemed \nalmost too good to be true. However, there they were, and \njudging by the way they demolished the eata.bles, they were \nvery palp1tble realities. Meehal had no doubt but that the \nmystic-looking chief, with the flowing beard, who sat in the \nchair of honour, was the great Finn, son of Cumhal. \nThe dark, tall youth opposite to him he knew to be Oscar, \nthe son of Oisin, and Conan Maol he knew by his truculent \nbearing and swaggering talk. \n\"How went the chase to-day, Oisin ? \" asked .Finn, \naddressing his son affectionately. \n\"I started the great boar of Glen-davaul,\" answered Oisin, \n\"and followed him from morn till noon. I w as close behind \nwhen I met this mortal in a glade, and so abandoned the chase.\" \nMeehal-na-Gamawn did not look up, but he felt the eagle \neyes of Finn upon him, reading his very soul. \n\"He is from the Land of Eirinn, sir,\" explained Oisin, \n\"and is here against his will.\" \n\"That's gospel truth, anyway,\" put in Meehal. \" I'd give \nanything to be back in Moondharrig, for this must be a foreign \ncountry altogether, from the quare way ye speak the Gaelic.\" \n\"I believe you are a very degenerate race in Erin, now­\nadays,\" said Finn, addressing the bewildered Gael. \" You \nhave been conquered by another people and the love of \nphysical progress has died amongst you.\" \n\"Thrue for you, your lordship,\" answered M.eehal bravely. \n\"The Sassenach beat us because we wouldn't stick together, \nbut in the regard ov a hurlin' match, or a bout o' wrnstlin,' \nwe have as neat a lot o' boys among us as ever.\" \nConan Maol broke in, boe,stful as usual. \" Your boys \nwould be puny wights in the hands of the Fenians at wrestling \nMOONDHARRIG VERSUS TIR-NA-N-OG. 111 \nor at the caman,\" said he. But Meehal-na-Gamawn was \naroused. \n\" Take care now, me big man,'' he cried. \"Take care me \nbucko-if eleven of the Moondharrig hurlers can't make fools \no' you in a gam e, an' if Dermot Roche, their captain, can't \nplough a ten-acre field with your nose at a bout o' wrastlin', \nI'm satisfied to stay in this wicked country an' never to hear a \nchfl,pel-bell again.\" \nConan glared savagely at the undaunted Meehal. \n\"The Fenians,\" he spluttered in a rage, '' the Fenians \nwould sweep your men even as Assaroe sweeps the dead leaves, \nand the goal-ball would be carried in the wind of their rush.\" \n\" Thrue for you, you big liar,\" retorted Meehal disdainfully, \n\"there's more wind than sinse in you, an' no mistake.\" \nGoll reached for a huge spear that hung over his head \nbut at a word from Finn fell back into his seat. \n\"You shall have a chance to make good your vaunting,'' \nsaid the chief, '' we will now adjourn to the plain of prowess, \nwhere Conan will bring his chosen men for the game.\" \nThe whole company now trooped out in the plain in front \nof the pahwe, whe1·e the Feni~ns were accustomed to -hold \ntheir contests. Oisin told his companion that it was modeled \nafter the plain of Tail tea in Meath, where the heroes when they \nwere on earth were wont to disport themselves. \n. C?nan in the mea~time was busy getting his men ready, \nd1vestmg them of their armour and putting on their swift­\nrnnning suits. At last they stood in line, caman in hand \neleven picked men, among whom he recognized Oscar and Goii \nMacMorna. \nWhile he was wondering where their opponents were to \ncome from, Finn suddenly drew apart from the rest, and \ncl~pped his hands together thrice. Like t?e clashing of iron \nsh10lds was the sound he made with his bare hands, and lo! as \nMeehal-na-Gamawn looked, there issued from the skirt of the \ngreenwood opposite. eleven men of the Moo ndharrio· hurlers \ndressed in their suits and with camans • in th.eir hanci\"'s.

It was the pick of all Moondharrig \nwithout any doubt. There was the captain, Dermot Roche, \nthe1·e was :Malachy Gilmartin and Will Hanlon the cul baire, \nand the matchless scriob, Pete O'Hara. The captain, he saw, \nhad recognized him and smiled faintly at him. Indeed there \nwas a look of sleep-walkers about all of them, but they seemed \nevery moment to be coming more like themselves, and the \nclick of the camans as the men lined up was calculated to \nrouse them from their trance. \nFinn walked once up and down the line counting the \nmen. Then coming to the end and shouting '' Ready,\" he \nflung the ball down the line of players.· There was a \ntremendous clash as the camans met, the mass of players \nswayed hither and thither across the field, then the knot broke \nand Oscar got the ball. So swiftly did he run that before the \n:Moondharrig backs got to their places he had passed them \n:.ind scored the first goal while all the exulting Fenians shouted \ntheir joy. But Dermot Roche was now thoroughly aroused, and \ncalling his men together, gave them a talk: \"Look here, \nboys,\" he said earnestly, \"I don't know where we are or what \nall this is about no more than you, but I see our friend Meehal­\nna-Gamawn among those people, an' it runs in my head some \ngreR.t harm will come to him if we don't win this match. Now, \nboys, except this chap that put up the goal, they can't run no \nmore than a parcel of old women, but they strike heavy an' \nhard, so ye must keep them from gettin' fair strokes at the \nball an' annoy them in every way you can. Malachy Gilmartin, \nyou'll attend to the boy that made the goal, see he doesn't get \naway again, if you have to crack him a sly one on the shins. \nAn' now, boys, for the sake of old Moondharrig, we'll take the \nnext two goals an' win the match.\" \nThere was a second line-up and again Finn threw in the \nball. This time it did not go towards the Moondharrig goal, \nbut slowly forged the other way. The fleet-footed Oscar got \nno chance for a run, being rudely jostled and pressed by the \nMOONDHARRlG VERSUS TIR-NA-N-OG. 113 \ntall, young woodranger, Malachy Gilmartin. The other \n~layers of the Fenians, great, heavy men, found their strokes­\nmterfered with in a madd~ning way. Eve1·y time they swung \n01;1 th? ball a Moondharng caman was poked in from some \ndirection or another and made the powerful blow futile. As \nthe game progresse~ the Fenian champions became plainly \nexas~erated and distressed. They were evidently out of \npractice, and unused to the modern tricks and combinations \nof their opponents, and soon showed symptoms of being \nplayed out. \nScarcely giving the ha.flied Fenians a look in. the Moon­\ndha~rig scriobs finally took the ball down into the enemy's \nterritory and passing it from man to man with the accuracy \nof clock-work, eluded the cul baire easily and scored, making \nthe honours even. \nWhen the ball was thrown in for the third and decidino· \ncontest Oscar made a desperate effort to get away with it. H~ \nwould have succeeded had Malachy Gilmartin been off his \nguard, but the young woodranger was on the alert and Oscar \nhad not stolen twenty yards when his ca man was blocked and \nt~e ball taken from him by Malachy, who could run like some \nwild thing of the woods he guarded. \nThe finish of this last game was almost a fiasco. There \nwas a swift r~sh down on the Fenian goal, and the ball zig-zaged \nnever touchmg but Moondharrig camans. Conan Maol was \nstanding with the Fenian goal-keeper trying to regain his \nb~eat~, when the irresistible Moondharrig rush struck him and \nhis big body was flung over and beyond the goal-line as a \nheavy boulder is flung from a powerful catapult!

See therefore that you waste not your \nstrength in idle talk.\" \nBeing apprised of the coming contest, Dermot Roche \nstood quietly waiting for his opponent. Tall arid sturdy and \nconfident, looked the young Captain, and in the eyes of Meehal, \nhis adorer, he was the finest and comeliest youth that ever \nstood on a green sward. \nThe burly Conan frowingly advanced and they locked in \na fierce embr ace. \nThe contest was not long in progress till it was plain that \nConan knew much less about the art of wrestling than his \nmodern opponent. Conan's method of attack was nothing \nmore than brute force applied openly and clumsily. Dermot \nRoche seemed to find no difficulty in meeting and cou11ter­\nchecking his attacks. The Fenian hero lifted his opponent \ntime and again off the ground and swung him in the air, but \nthe modern Gael always landed, smiling, on his feet again. \nAt length these stupendous efforts began to tell on Conan \nMaol, and presently he was panting and almost breathless. \nThen the Moondharrig Captain took the aggressive, and \nConan got no chance to recuperate. By a countless number of \ntricks and feints, Dermot Roche kept his opponent in a \nconstant state of alarm, exhausting his remaining strength. \n\"It's comin' now,\" whispered Meehal-na-Gamawn to Oisiu. \n\"Dermot is goin' to do it. I see the look in his eyes he had \nwhen he threw the English champion at Gurtharda, an' broke \nhis collar-bone.\" \n\"Are you goin' to give him the treasgairt, Dermot ? \" he \nasked, speaking in English, which the Fenians didn't und er­\nstand.

The \nCaptain himself could not do it neater or swifter. Many a time \nthe Gaels sighed as they thought what a tower of strength the \nyoung curate would be to them in the championship matches \nif it were not \"against the rules.\" It is to be presumed, too, \nthat Father John himself often wished he could lend a hand \nwhen the ball came rushing dangerously on the Moondharrig \ngoal. With all his training in self-control he was observed to \nwatch the games with intense interest, and to be elated or de­\npressed according to the varying fortunes of the contest. \nAt the time of which we write a great match for the \ncounty championship was impending between Moondharrig \nand Tullagmore. Great was the anxiety regarding the issue, \nfor that was to decide which of the two grM,t teams would \nhave the honour of entering the provincial contests. For the \nfirst time for years Father John found his sympathies divided. \nHe would like to see his native parish, Tullagmore, a winner; \nand on the other hand he shrank from the thought of seeing \nMoondharrig, which he had come to love, suffer the bitterness \nof defeat. \nIt was a wild night in the month of March, and the young \ncurate was sitting up late over his books.

The horsemen \ncould no longer sit erect in their saddles but had to bend \nbehind their horse's herds to escape the feeling of suffocation. \nWith the howl of ten thousand demons the hurricane \nswept through the narrow defile, often bringing the horses to \nf1 standstill and making them stagger in their tracks. \nTo the priest, intent on his supernatural errand, it seemed \n:1s though diabolical force was being used against them to \nhamper and delay. \nIrresistibly there came into his mind II weird legend cur­\nrent in that part of the country, and the scene of which they \nhad just passed. A priest, said the legend, had been called \nhastily in the night to a~tend a dying p~rson. He imme­\ndiately hurried on his way , and m:ide good progress as far as \na certain ruined castle that stood. by the way-side. As the \nTHE FINAL GOAL. 119 \npriest drew nigh to this ancient fortress, dim and solemn in \nthe moonlight, he thought he heard some unusual sounds and \npaused to ascertain their nature. Presently a voice of super­\nhuman sweetness and beauty floated out from the ruin singing \nthe old Irish air called .An Cailin dhas cruidthe na-m-bo. \nSuch was the magic and charm of that wonderful voice \nthat the poor priest forgot his pressing and sacred duty and \nstood like one in a trance until the singing ceased. Then the \nspell being broken he stepped forward a few paces and looked \ninside the ruin. \nTo his horror there was no human being there, but in a \nshaft of moonlight on the grass-grown floor sat a great wolf­\nhound, that glared at him with hateful eyes of fil'e ! \nWith a shock of anguish and shame the priest realised \nthat he had been delayed on his sacred errand by a ruse of the \nevil one. \nHr,stening forward he endeavoured to make up for lost \ntime, but to no purpose, for when he arrived at the house of \nthe man to whom be had been called he found him already \ndead! The atonement made by the priest of the legend for \nthis momentary carelessness w11s an after0 life of rigorous \npenance and austerity. \nFather Dermody prayed that the hidden God reposing \nnow at his breast mi ght save him always from the sorrow of \nbeing too late to comfort a poor soul in agony and need. His \ncompanions, too, were praying, and the Divine presence brought \ncomfort and assurance to their hearts. \nAnd now as they reached the summit of the \"Gap of the \nWinds,\" where had the storm continued in unabated fury \nthere would have been danger of being blown to destruction \nover the high cliffs that here impended, suddenly came a \nstrange and unaccountable lull. \nThis continued until the party descended from the ex­\nposed ridge into the skelter of the bulging mountain side. \nThe worst of the road was now behind them, . and with grate­\nful hearts they urged their horses to a gallop, nor drew reins \ntill they brought up in front of the cottage of Meehal-na­\nGamawn. The mother of the latter met them at the door, and \nthere was a relieved and thankful look on her face as she sa IV'",

Leaving the others in the little kitchen, the \npriest immediately entered the room of the sick man, and \nclosed the door behind him. \nPlacing the Blessed Sacrament on a small table on which \na blessed candle was burning, he reverently genuflected, and \nwent over to the sick-bed. Meehal-na-Gamawn turned upon \nhim a look of wistful joy that was pathetic to see. \"May \nGod bless you, father, I knew you'd come,\" he said in a weak \nvoice. At a glance the priest could see that the shadow of \ndeath lay there already, and that poor Meehal would never \nagain see the light of day in this vale of tears. \nPutting on his stole, the priest heard the dying man's \nconfession. Then calling in the mother and the two Gaels he \nbade them kneel down while he administered the Holy \nVia tic um. \nIt was a solemn and peaceful scene in that little chamber, \nwhile outside the heavy din of the storm rose and fell. \nTears flowed fast down the manly cheeks of the Gaels as \nthey saw the priest bending to give the last Communion, \nwhile Meehal-na-Gamawn, their beloved friend, welcomed his \nGod with the most tender sentiments of love and hope. How \nsmall and trivial and foolish appeared 2.11 earthly struggles \nand jealousies and triumphs in the presence of this awful \nhour of death! They struck their breasts and prayed for \npardon for their sins, and that a holy and well-prepared-for \ndeath might also be their happy portion at the end of their \nlives. Ah ! well indeed had they loved their dying friend, \n9,nd could it be possible, even now, they would gladly die in \nhis place! \nAnd the noble Irish mother knelt bravely there with a \nhalo of sainthood about her sweet face, and like many another \nstrong-hearted Irish mother offers her son to God without \nreserve. Then the priest performed the rast solemn anointing, \nand gave the blessing in exfrernis to further strengthen that \nsoul that was now girding itself for the final ordeal. \nAn anxious look came into the eyes of Me ehs,l-na-Gamawn. \nTHE FINAL GOAL. 121 \n\"There's one thing, father, that's troublin' me,\" said he, \n\"an' I forgot to tell it to you.\" \nThe two Gaels turned to leave the room, but he beckoned \nthem back. \"It's this, father, I've been sayin' prayers here \nfor th? last fe~ days that t;h? boys here would defeat Tullag­\n:nore m the big match ; an I m sorry now I did, for Tullagmore \nis your home, father, and likely you'd feel badly if they were \nbeaten. I had no right to do it, an' it grieves me now, father, \nthat I did.\" The priest turned away to hide his tears, which \nwhich were now flowing fast. \"It was no harm at all you did, \nMeehal,\" he said, in a broken voice. \" I won't mind it a bit \nif Tullagmore loses, and I know now the boys here will win \non account of your prayers.\"· \nSlowly the night hours dragged past, and the dying man \nlapsed into unconsciousness. From his incoherent sentences \nthey could gather that he was wandering once again with his \nfriends, the Gaels. Once again he watched them run and \nstrike the swift-bounding ball. \nWith strange thrills the Captain and Malachy heard him \ncall out their names-now in tones of entreaty, anon in tones \nof pride and commendation, as though they had just performed \nsome wondrous feat. \nThe priest, closely observant, noted a great change coming \nslowly over the features of the dying man. \n\"We will recite the last litanies now, in the name of \nGod,\" he said. \nPutting the crucifix in the hand of Meehal-na-Gamawn \nthe priest knelt, and began the \" Recommendation of a Soui \nDeparting.\" \nAs he did so, consciousness returned for a few moments \nto the dying Gael, and with great effort he made the first \n1'0Sponses. \"Lord have ~ercy on me,\" he prayed. \"Christ \nhave mercy on me-Holy Mary pray for me,\" then once again \nhe became delirious. \n_Outsi~e through the lone mountain passes, making a \nmusic ternble to hear, the thousand mighty voices of the storm \nrose in hoarse _diapason! \n.

Now, \nthe wind wailed in long-drawn cadences like the desolate \ncrooning of Beansidhe; again a sudden gust seemed to shake \nthe very ground, like the innermost discharge of heavy \nartillery. \nWithin the sick-room the not less terrible and solemn \nlitanies of the Church thundered forth their defiance against \nthe Enemy of Mankind. \n\"Depart, oh Christian soul,\" spoke the priest, \"out of \nthis miserable world, in the Name of God the Father Who \ncreated thee; in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the \nLiving God, Who Redeemed thee; in the Name of the Holy \nGhost, Who sanctified thee.

But as to the just, let them rejoice and be \nhappy in His presence. May all the demons of hell be filled \nwith confusion and shame, and let no evil spirit dare to stop \nthy course to Heaven.\" \nThen the voice of the priest trembled and broke, as he \npra.yed for the soul of his friend :-\n\" Deliver, oh Lord, the soul of Thy servant from all dangers \nof hell, and from n.11 pain and tribulation! \n\"Deliver, ob Lord, tho soul of Thy servant, as Thou didst \ndeliver Lot from f.:blom and the fhmes of fire ! \nTHE FINAL GOAL. 123 \n. \"Deliv~r, ob Lord, the soul of Thy servant, as Thou didst \ndeliver Damel from the lion's den! \n. \"Deliver, oh Lord, the soul of Thy servant, as Thou didst \ndeliver the three children from the fiery furnace. Amen.\" \nM?ehal-na-Gamawn in his delirium seemed to be gazing \nat a CJo;is-fought contest of the Gaels. A great excitement \nshowed on his features, and the hurlers heard their names on \nhis lips again and again. \n. And at first all seemed to be going well with his friends \nm the phantom hurling match, but after some time his face \ngrew downcast, and he muttered repeatedly, \"We are goin' \nto lose-we are goin' to lose !-Moondharrig is lost !-is lost!\" \nThen with startling suddenness he raised himself on one \narm. His voice grew strong, and tense, and eager:-\n\" Ah!\" he cried, \"the Captain has it, at last-he has the \nball! He forces it towards tho goal. God aid you, Captain \nasthore ! Nearer, nearer he comes and they cannot stop him. \nAh! what a stroke !-a goal !-a go9J ! God bless you Captain l \n-it is the final goal I\" \n. Meehal-na-Gamawn fell back on his pillow, and once \nagam, by God's mercy, for a moment of full consciousness, \nhe cast a farewell glance on his heartbroken friends:-\n\" Jesus, Mary, and Joseph assist me,\" he murmured. \nThen like a sudden ripple dying off a still pool the life \nwent out of his face !

      "raw_text": "The Final Goal. \nTHE M6ondharrig \"Gaels,\" besides being peerless athletes \nwere also, as was fitting, sincere and devout members of t~e \nancient church. Without exception they were to be found m \ntheir places at Mass every Sunday of the ~e~1·, and ~hey were \nas regular in attending to their oth?r rehg10us duties. The \nfaith in them was strong and practical and kept them free \nfrom the dangers to which young men are exposed who have \nnot the support of earnest spiritual conviction. \nNoble specimens of manhood, indeed, were the _Gaels-:­\nmodern Sir Galahads in the purity of their morals-m thetr \nhorror of lewd speech or action. One might be in their com­\npany for years, yet never hear a prof~ne or_ a loose word. \nIn the standing records of athletic achievement the names \nof champions of the Gaelic Athletic Association of Ireland­\nthe modern \"Gaels \"-are emblazoned high and frequent. \nHas not this rectitude of life, this respect for their strong, \nyoung bodies-the \"temples of the H_oly Ghost \"-?1uch to do \nwith placing these natural and untramed at~letes m the fore­\nfront of the world's physical prowess and achievement? \nIn Moondharri(J' the Gaels were encouraged and supported \nby their parish prie~t, who saw that exercise an~ ~mulation \nwere good for them physically and mentally, givi~g them \nbesides an interest and a pride in their country, which ~ept \nthem from being swept away in the ruinous torrent of emigra-\ntion. \n. The love which the Gaels gave in return to the~r belo~ed \npastor was deep and resistless as their own noble Suir at high \ntide. . \n'.}'he younger curate, Father John Dermody, had _a still \nstron(J'er claim on their affections. Had he not been m the \ndays before his ordination-a time all of them could remem­\nber-one of themselves, an athlete and a Gael? Not ten year!! \nTHE FINAL GOAL. 117 \nback he had played with Tullagmore, their greatest rivals, in \na memorable struggle against Moondharrig, when the latter \nhad to bow to defeat \nOftentimes, even now, he would come into the practice \nfield, and borrowing a caman give the ball a few strokes that \nwere a delight to see, such skill and nerve was in them. The \nCaptain himself could not do it neater or swifter. Many a time \nthe Gaels sighed as they thought what a tower of strength the \nyoung curate would be to them in the championship matches \nif it were not \"against the rules.\" It is to be presumed, too, \nthat Father John himself often wished he could lend a hand \nwhen the ball came rushing dangerously on the Moondharrig \ngoal. With all his training in self-control he was observed to \nwatch the games with intense interest, and to be elated or de­\npressed according to the varying fortunes of the contest. \nAt the time of which we write a great match for the \ncounty championship was impending between Moondharrig \nand Tullagmore. Great was the anxiety regarding the issue, \nfor that was to decide which of the two grM,t teams would \nhave the honour of entering the provincial contests. For the \nfirst time for years Father John found his sympathies divided. \nHe would like to see his native parish, Tullagmore, a winner; \nand on the other hand he shrank from the thought of seeing \nMoondharrig, which he had come to love, suffer the bitterness \nof defeat. \nIt was a wild night in the month of March, and the young \ncurate was sitting up late over his books. The clock showed \nclose on midnight when he knelt down to say the beads before \nretiring. Outside a fearful storm howled and moaned in long \ndrawn gusts, and torrential rains swept the windows. \nSuddenly the door bell rang, sou.nding harshly in a lull \nof the storm. The young priest started up from his knees. It \ncould mean only one thing-a sick call, and terribly urgent it \nmust be to bring people out on such a night. \nThe call of duty always found Father John ready and \ncheerful ; yet he might be pardoned for feeling a certain sink­\ning of the heart at the prospect of a long journey in storm and \ndarkness. Lighting a small lantern kept for such occasions, he \nwent quickly down stairs and unbolted the front door. Two",

A public \nmeeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce with a \nview to promoting this Munster and Connacht industrial \n- enterprise. The meeting was a very representative one. \nFather J. M.

John Lee, C.C .. ; W. F. M'Namara--these various \nclasses of men were amongst those present, and their \nnames indicate the broad and representative basis upon \nwhich the proposed exhibition in July of next year is \nto be carried out. \nMr. T. A. Ferguson proposed \"that an Industrial \nExhibition be held in Limerick, opening the first week \nin July, 1906, to be called 'The Munster and Connacht \nIndustrial Exhibition.\" In supporting this resolution \nMr. James S. Gaffney, Solr., in the course of his re­\nmarks as reported in the ~/Jfunster 1Yews, said:-\" It was \na great pity that they, Limerick people, and Irish \npeople as a whole, especially in the South of Ireland, \nshould not rely sufficiently on themselves, and show that \nreliance by buying where they could goods made in Ire­\nland that were as good and cheap as goods made else­\nwhere (hear, hear). He_ had 3:dopted the practice in his \nown household of buymg Irish-manufactured goods. \nThe crux was, would things be got as good and as cheap \nin Ireland as elsewhere, and in that relation he had seen \na most interesting corresp01idence in a newspaper with \nsome of the views of which many people did not agree­\nhe meant the Dublin LEADER, which had done au enor­\nmous amount of good for the manufacturers of Ireland \n(hear, bear)-a correspondence a~ to _whether people \nshould buy Irish goods even at prices higher than those \npaid for the foreign goods, and he saw that the vas~ ma­\njority, of the manufacturers of Ireland were unammous \nin saying that they did not want any patronage on t~e \ngrouud that they were Irish mauufactul'Crs-they chcl \nnot want anybody to buy goods from them excep~ they \nwere as good and as cheap as goods manufactured many \npart of the world (hear, hear). If they put that forward \nin supporting this Exhibition, it would be a success.\" \nA Committee consisting of the E ,xecutive of the Lime­\nrick Industrial Association and the following-with \npower to adcl to their numbers--were appointed to carry \nout the arrangements for the. Munster and Connacht \nExhibition of 1906 :-Sir Thomas Cleave, Messrs. J. E. \nGoodbody, Archibald Murray, James Quin, Samu 'el Lee, \nWilliam Lloyd, David Tidmarsh, John Egan, A. Bar­\nnett, W. L.

There are possibly \" unauthorised \" Coons \nas well as \" unauthorised\" Gaelic L~aguers I And if the \nGaelic League authorities are above criticism, why \nshould not the Coons, also, be exempt 7 Very Rev. \nCanon Flavin, P .P., au Irish speaker, is Director of the \nT em perance Sodality, but Canon Flavin is not respon­\nsible for this un-Irisb programme. We are informed \nthat Canon Flavin, with his own money acquired two \nhouses (one of them a drunkery, the licence of which he \nextinguished). These two houses he reconstructed, ex­\ntended, furnished, fitted and converted into a Tem ­\nperance Hall for the benefit of his parishioners. The \nworking tnen themselves were given a free band in mak­\ning out the programme of their first concert, and the· \ninnane and unnational thing that we have been refer­\ning to was the result. More than one member of the \nCommittee attempted to hav.e national songs introduced, \nbut to no purpose. The performers, all, we understand, \n\"patriots \" of the greenest type, were more concerned \nabout showing off their powers as vocalists in nigger and \nEnglish lyrics than singing even Anglo-Irish songs like \n\"The Wearing o' the Green,\" \"Who fears to speak of \n'98,\" or even Moore's melodies. But as persons \"ob­\nnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" what business is it of ours? \nSome members of the Executive of the Gaelic League \nshould look aHer these niggers of Clonmel. \nWe have received a report of the annual meeting of \nthe Duhallow C'oisde C'eanntair which was held recently \na,t Boherbee. Father P'. O'Regan, C.O., Vice-President, \nwas in the chair. The Secretary's report was as \nfollows :-The C'oiscle was established at a meeting held \nin Kanturk, on March 25th, 190-4, and bas been, there­\nfore, something more than twelve months in existence. \nDuring that time eight meetings have been held and \ntwenty-five resolutions passed, and this represents the \nsum total of the work .of your body. When the Coi~de \nwas established all the six branches of which it consists \nwere conducting Irish classes; but owing to the want of \na competent teacher among their members, no classes \nwere conducted in two of these branches during last \nsession. It will, therefore, be seen that the language \nis in a worse condition in Duhallow at present than it \nwas twelve months ago. vVere it not for the a.ction, or \nrather inaction, of your Coiscle and of the Coiscle \nGnotlw, these two branches would probably have \nmanaged to have classes somehow. As early \nas M'ay last, the question of appointing a \ntravelling teacher for the Coisde C'ecmntair area was \nunder consideration, but was postponed to \nOctober. vVlien the matter was brought on again at \ntlie October meeting, the majority of the delegates re­\nfused to take any action-on it, and would not even ask \nthe C'oiscle Gnotlui for a subsidy towards paying a teacher \nfor the branches that had none. The Secretary of one \nof the branches affected, seeing that no help was to be \nexpected from yom body, explained to the Goisde Gnotha \nthat his branch would fall through unless they got \nsome aid from the Central body to help them to pay \nthe salary of a teacher.

A public \nmeeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce with a \nview to promoting this Munster and Connacht industrial \n- enterprise. The meeting was a very representative one. \nFather J. M. Cl·egan, Adm ., to whose energy is to be \ncredited the St. Itas' Shirt Factory of Limerick, E. Cole \n~elson, James Flynn, City High Sheriff; G. Spillane, \nAlderman S. O'Mara, F. 0. Cle.eve, J.P.; R. Gibson, \nSir Charles Barrington, M. O'Gallaghan, Gerald Good­\nbody, T. Geary, E.. J. Long, M. D. Shaw, David Tid­\nmarsh, J . S. Gaffney, Solr.; J. O'Grady Delmege, D .L. ; \nRev. John Lee, C.C .. ; W. F. M'Namara--these various \nclasses of men were amongst those present, and their \nnames indicate the broad and representative basis upon \nwhich the proposed exhibition in July of next year is \nto be carried out. \nMr. T. A. Ferguson proposed \"that an Industrial \nExhibition be held in Limerick, opening the first week \nin July, 1906, to be called 'The Munster and Connacht \nIndustrial Exhibition.\" In supporting this resolution \nMr. James S. Gaffney, Solr., in the course of his re­\nmarks as reported in the ~/Jfunster 1Yews, said:-\" It was \na great pity that they, Limerick people, and Irish \npeople as a whole, especially in the South of Ireland, \nshould not rely sufficiently on themselves, and show that \nreliance by buying where they could goods made in Ire­\nland that were as good and cheap as goods made else­\nwhere (hear, hear). He_ had 3:dopted the practice in his \nown household of buymg Irish-manufactured goods. \nThe crux was, would things be got as good and as cheap \nin Ireland as elsewhere, and in that relation he had seen \na most interesting corresp01idence in a newspaper with \nsome of the views of which many people did not agree­\nhe meant the Dublin LEADER, which had done au enor­\nmous amount of good for the manufacturers of Ireland \n(hear, bear)-a correspondence a~ to _whether people \nshould buy Irish goods even at prices higher than those \npaid for the foreign goods, and he saw that the vas~ ma­\njority, of the manufacturers of Ireland were unammous \nin saying that they did not want any patronage on t~e \ngrouud that they were Irish mauufactul'Crs-they chcl \nnot want anybody to buy goods from them excep~ they \nwere as good and as cheap as goods manufactured many \npart of the world (hear, hear). If they put that forward \nin supporting this Exhibition, it would be a success.\" \nA Committee consisting of the E ,xecutive of the Lime­\nrick Industrial Association and the following-with \npower to adcl to their numbers--were appointed to carry \nout the arrangements for the. Munster and Connacht \nExhibition of 1906 :-Sir Thomas Cleave, Messrs. J. E. \nGoodbody, Archibald Murray, James Quin, Samu 'el Lee, \nWilliam Lloyd, David Tidmarsh, John Egan, A. Bar­\nnett, W. L. Stokes, P. E. Bourke together with the \nManagers of the five Banks in the city. \nThere was a \" Grand Christy Minstrel \" entertain­\nment and· concert at St. lVfary's Temperance Hall, Irish­\ntown, Glomnel. A programme of the great event is \nbefore us. The strenuous, manly and self-respecting \nmajority at a recent meeting of the Executive of the \nGaelic League in Dublin should look after the Olonmel \nniggers. 1'hey had no Irish vocal items, nay,, even \nmore, they had no Anglo-Irish vocal item at their enter­\ntainment at St. Mary's Temperance Hall, Irishtown, \nOlonmel, and yet no \"unauthorised persons\" even \n·\" held up\" Bones I • One of the niggers sang \"Looking \nfor a Coon like me.\" vVho was looking for him 7 As \nwe are persons \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" perhaps \nwe have no right to intrude our enquiries into such mat­\nters. Why should we ask questions of Coons if we may \nnot ask a question of the Central Body of the Gaelic \nLeague? There are possibly \" unauthorised \" Coons \nas well as \" unauthorised\" Gaelic L~aguers I And if the \nGaelic League authorities are above criticism, why \nshould not the Coons, also, be exempt 7 Very Rev. \nCanon Flavin, P .P., au Irish speaker, is Director of the \nT em perance Sodality, but Canon Flavin is not respon­\nsible for this un-Irisb programme. We are informed \nthat Canon Flavin, with his own money acquired two \nhouses (one of them a drunkery, the licence of which he \nextinguished). These two houses he reconstructed, ex­\ntended, furnished, fitted and converted into a Tem ­\nperance Hall for the benefit of his parishioners. The \nworking tnen themselves were given a free band in mak­\ning out the programme of their first concert, and the· \ninnane and unnational thing that we have been refer­\ning to was the result. More than one member of the \nCommittee attempted to hav.e national songs introduced, \nbut to no purpose.

If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G.

In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know .

Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V.

And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter.

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

The bulk of the licensed traders of Dublin have to work very hard all the t.welve calendar mouths of the year to make an honest living and pay their way, and here is a picture of a young man , who I understand does nothing at all for a living, dictating to those men as to what they should do on St. Patrick's Day .

Now if an instance were wanting of their sheer \nincapaC'ity to rise to the occasion, or .to take a common­\nsense view of a question by seeking the assistance and \nhelp of the local bodies, where the L .G.B. themselves \na.re lamentably ignorant of the matter involved, it is \nsupplied in the amusing, but somewhat tragic, episode \nwhich is now in progress at Clifden and Swinford. Re­\nlief works to meet tho famine in the West is not an \namusing subject, but the Local Government Board, by \nLESSONS IN IRISH by Correspondence. For particulars o.pply \nto Principal All Ireland Corresponclence College, SB Lower Abbey \nStreet, Dublin. \ntheir extraordinary proceedings, have contrived to give \na good comedy effect to such a dismal matter. i \nIt appears cer_tain sums o_f money have been ,,Hotted \nby the G'overnment from Irish funds to enable , public \nworks\" to be carried on in the Clifden Union, and the \nL.G .B., as usual, seeing a chance •of exercising their• \npatronage--a virtue which they conspicuously shinct in­\nappointed a se~ of officials to oversee and to ,superyise the \npoor folks who were to get the shilling a day foi· the \nla.hour they gave on certain public works. Thq local \nPoor Law Guardians, knowing who were the most ~eedy \nas well a.s the m ost capable and the most, entitled to get \nthis miserable dole for their long day's la.hour, made out \na list of such persons which had to be submitted to the \noverseers. In every instance, however, where _the un­\nfortunate applicants had the smallest remnant of \"pro­\nperty,\" such as a sheep, a pig, or a calf, they were re­\nfused work, and m any of them had to tramp back to \ntheir wretched homes , a double distance of ten miles \nca.ch wav, footsore, weary, and hungry, with empty \nstomachs and still emptier pockets. On the other \nhand, the overseers selected the blind, and the halt, and \nthe lame who , unfit for any labour, were not possessed \nof any \"property,\" but who were already on the out-door \nrelief list, aud set them to work . After a short time it \nwas found t-he number of overseers exceeded the work­\nmen , and the scandal became so notorious that even that \nself-complacent body-the L.G .B .-could not stand \nit. Representations were again made by the Local \nGuardians and ~he clergy, that the fact of a man owning ·· \na pig, or a sheep, did uot prevent him and his family,. \nwhen the potatoes had given out, and there was no job \nto wo~k at, from being destitute, hungry, and actually \nin need of food. These men and their children were wil­\nling to work. Some of them had even to walk eight \nmiles to, and eight miles back, from the scene of their \nla hours-an evidence of their desire to earn an honest \ncrust, if allowed to do so. \nThe local overseers, how ever, stuck rigidly to their \nrules--no such person would, or could, be employed by \nthem on the public works. Even the willingness to \nwalk sixteen miles daily, to toil for a shilling a day, did \nuot appeal to their strong consciences. Rules had to be \nobeyed. People might perish from hunger; but the \nsacred laws made bv the L.G.B . were to be carried out \nand upheld at all cost. No such persons, though nomi­\nnated by the parish priest, or the local Guardian, both \nof whom were fair judges of the workman 's circum­\nstances, and the necessity to relieve him, were ignored. \nThe L.G.B 's. official overseer was the omnipotent man . \nHe knew nothing of the country or the people, therefore • \nhe was better qualified to deal ,vith these cases and re­\nfuse these men work. Now, coufd the force of folly \nfarther go 1 Here were the priest and the local Guar­\ndian, who knew each applicant personally, and the cir­\ncumstances of his case. They had the knowledge from \npersonal experience whether t.lie applicant's case was a \nbona ficle one or a fraud. Ye~ their opinion is treated \nwith contempt; they are ignored, a.nd their l.ocal know • \nledge set aside for a stranger's, who is ignorant alike of \nthe people and the country. • \nTl1e next scene in this miserable farce-and it is \nalmost painful to write c'oolly about it, is-the L .G .B . \nashamed or the state of affairs, and fearing probably \nthat some Irish member would raise a question about \nit in the House of Commons, wrote the follow111g letter \nto tho Guardians, who , we a.re glad to say, have not re­\nlieved the \"_l,. G .B.\" of their responsibility by_ getting \nrid of the \" overseers '' appointed by the ·gentlemen at. \nthe Custom House.

APRIL 15, 1905. \n1·eservedly withdraw the allegations made against Mr. \nHazelton, and again tender him my apology.'' .Per­\nhaps, it would be cruel to add anything to this \nhumiliating crawl down on the part of this paper \nthat styles itself\" T'/ie Irish V intner and Grocer.\" That \ncult~ll\"ed organ o_f opinion had better be more care­\nful m future. The swagger, language and manners of \nthe publichouse may be dangerous when reproduced in \npublic print. \nOne of the presiding geniuses of the Great Sourface \nRailway some time back dumped a.n importation from \nGreat Britain upon these shores. Needless to say the \ndump was \" saved \" he also had au \" accent.\" He was \nbrought ove1· here, we believe, in order to show some of \nthe mere Irish officials of the Great Sourface Railway \nhow to do their business. He was shifted \nabout from post to pillar, and has now been \nshifted back to his native Britain under cir­\ncumstances which are not devoid of humour. \nThe Great Sourface Railway have embarked on an ad­\nvertising enterprise in Lancashire, where the trippers \ncome from. A firm by the name of Hilliard, of Kil­\nlarney-needless to say, the firm is \"saved \"-were \ncharged with the work of supplying a horse, a side-car, \nand a driver, to further on this great advertising idea \nthat was conceived in the brain of one of the Great \nSourface officials. We do not know whether or not the \ndriver of the material manifestation of thi~ great idea \nis \" saved \" or not; and the nationality of the honest \nhorse is. also unknown to us. A \"poster \" a:dorns the \nside-car, and the poster is a reproduction of a picture by \na Frenchman who was imported for the job, and the \nreproduction was carried out in France. Whether all \nthis great nation-making enterprise was carried out \nunder the guidance of the conquering brain of \nNapoleon Dent, an importation who draws £2,000 \na year out .of the revenue of the Great Sour­\nface Railway, or whether it was a man by the name \nof Smith who looked after the details, we cannot say; \nbut the dump to whom we referred in the beginning of \nthis note has been drafted back to happy England, and \nwe understand that his duties are to distribute bills in \nLancashire in connection with the tour through that \nshire of the side-car adorned by the French pictme. \nHe was brought over to show the mere Irish clerks how \nto do their work; now he is drafted back to England­\nand probably he will be accepted by the Lancashire \ntrippers as a native specimen of the Gap of Dunloe ! \nMessrs. Richardson and Fletcher, Manure Manufac­\nturers, Dublin, invite suggestions for their 190•6· Alma­\nnac. The subject must be taken from au Irish source. \nA prize of £5 will be awarded for the best suggestion. \nIntending competitors can obtain full particulars from \nlocal agents or direct from the firm in Dublin. \nThe Dublin Industrial Development Association is \nbeing wrought into shape, and there is reason to hope \nthat it will do as much for Dublin manufacturers as \nthe Cork Association did for those of Corle. Mr. George \nPerry presided at the last Council meeting, and prac­\ntical men like John Irwin, T.O ., John Mulligan, Alder­\nman Reigh, and the like were present, and we note \nthat Mr. Robert Woods, of Williams and Woods, the \n, well-known Dublin jam manufacturers, and Mr. J . P. \nBarrington, of the famous soap firm, and Mr. W . E. \nShackleton, of Lucan, were co-opted on the Council. \nThese class of men must take a very prominent, if not a \ncontrolling part in the Industries Development Associa­\ntion, if it is _to be a success, and we are glad to see that \nso many of this class are interesting themselves in it. \nMr. McVeagh's Return, if we may style it so, is up­\nsetting the Ascendancy very much. That, of course, \nis quite natural. Mr. Moore wanted ,to know if officials \nof the Government Departments in Ireland were free to \ndecline to reveal the places where they were educated, \nand Mr .. Long replied that he was advised that the \nGovernment had no legal right to demand an answer \nto the que11tion. Now this is all humbug. The \nGov,1rnment ha11 passed the 01·der for this Enquiry, and \nsurely £he Imperial Parliament havo a legal right to ask \nany of its salaried servants wher~ _he wa,s educated. Was \nit from Mr. Campbell, the Sohmtor-General, that. the \nlegal opinion was received 1 If Mr. Long, or the head \nof any Public Department has no power ~o com~el \nanswers to these questions, su~·ely the Imperia.1 Parl!a­\n·meut has power. Mr. Long, 1t appea1·s from a Parlia­\nmentary press report, indignantly replied; \"No, Sir, \nnot the slightest reason,\" to. Captain Donelan's per­\ntinent question-\" Has the right ~on. gentleman any \nreason to suppose that the officials concerned are \nashamed to give this information.\" Mr. McVeagh cer­\ntainly has got the Ascendancy in a nasty predicament. \nThe .o.1,-o Co tree of .0.11 Cum <'11 C.omo5un'.>e.6_<'.:c \nheld a special meeting in the rooms 8 North Fredenck \nSt. on SattU\"day, April 8tih, and decided to accept a c:up \nand set of medals kindly presented to them by ~he Insh \nRevival Industries CoIJ_Jmittee for Camo~u1dheacht \nTournament.

The LEADER in­\ncident is one of the items with which the E xecutive Com­\nmittee deals. It will be remembered that at a mel!ting \nof the committee of the Cavan Branch of the Gaelic \nLeague it was unanimously resolved that the secretary be \ndirected to enquire from the Central Executive whether \nany steps had been, or are intended to be, taken to re­\npudiate the action of the roughs concerned in the LEADER \nincident. \"vVe see, in the course of a report in the \n.Anglo-Celt, of Apri_l 8th, that a letter was \nread stating that the Gaelic League had no \nconnection with the incident that occurred during \nthe Language Procession in Dublin. Of course, that is \nnot good enough. The League is so mixed up in it tlia.t \nit will have to expressly shake itself free of it. The pre­\nprocession resolution passed by the Dublin Co1r-oe \nCe c,nnc.0111 is, at least, in a sort of continuity with the \nincident; the subsequent absurd resolution of the \nsame body only added insult to injury; the re­\nmarks made at a public meeting held before Lan­\nguage ViTeek under the auspices of the League, and \nover which one of the Vice-Presidents presided, were at, \nleast in continuity with the incident; a paper that has \nbeen ostentatiously styled a \" confrere \" by the o:fficia,J \norgan of the Gaelic League applauded the blackguards \nof the procession and endorsed their conduct; the officia.l \norgan contained no expression of regret, however formal, \nfor the corner-boy episode. We submit that it is for \nthe Co1r-oe 5not,., now to expressly denounce the \noutrage and repudiate all connection with the corner­\nboys who committed it, and with those who subsequently \nendorsed it. Unfortunately, some of the Gaelic League \nauthorities up to this have shown a lamentable lack of \ntact and diplomacy. For the sake of the Language \nMovement, which is above all persons and parties, we \ntrust that the Co1r-oe 511ot,,at this its first meeting after \nthe incident, will appreciate the gravity of the matter \nand deal with it with a strong ancl firm hand. If it be \npossible that any minority, however small, cannot see \ntheir way to fall in with the spirit of the protests, speci­\nmens of which we have been publishing, we hope that \nthe members of such a minority will give the Irish­\nIreland public the benefit of their names. 'l''here is no \nroom iu the Executive body of the Gaelic League for \nanyone whose partisanship towards any political organi­\nsation prevents him falling in loyally with the spirit and \npurpose of ,the Gaelic League. \nAt a Committee meeting of the Olonmel Gaelic League \nheld on Sunday evening, the 9th inst., in the Gaelic \nHall, Clonmel, the following resolution was passed \nu1rn.nimously :-Resolved-\" That we, the members of \nthe Clonmel Branch of the Gaelic League, desire to re­\ncord our deep regret that the governing body of the \nLeague has not before now thought well to disassociate \nitself from any appearance of sympathy with those who",

His natural bent found\nneighbourly encouragement, and in June of the following year he\nmade his debut upon the home track. He failed in the sprints—for\nwhich he never possessed the essentials of height and weight—but\nwon the 440 yards and half-mile from runners of high provincial\nrepute. Later in that season he won the half mile and mile at Carbury,\nand mile events at Celbridge and Kilcock. His best performance that.\nyear was his contest over half a mile with J. J.

He had twenty\nyards start, and was beaten by three yards in 2 mins. 0 2-5 secs.—\nnot bad time any day under such conditions as then prevailed.\nSubsequently he ran another great race against a noted Leinster\nrunner at Kildare.

          "text": "The defects of this system of centralised control soon became apparent. The scope of its duties was too extensive. It could give little or no attention to local organisation or difficulties, and anything like a full Council meeting was difficult to secure. The burden of constant representation fell heavy on many counties, with the result that decisions on important matters were taken in many instances by parties too keenly interested to be impartial. The championship entries never reflected the strength of the Association during those years. The formation of the Provincial Councils removed these defects and solved many other vexatious problems. _ These bodies were constituted. for Munster and Leinster in 1900; Connacht followed in 1902, and Ulster in 1903. Early in the last year the Constitution of the provincial authorities was approved by the Annual Congress at Thurles, and, a happy augury of progress, the junior championships were also recognised.",

Provincial Councils comprise two delegates from each county, and at annual convention a chairman, secretary, and treasurer are elected. The custom now is to regard the secretary as a permanent official. This ensures efficiency and continuity in the work of this pivotal office. With the delegation of inter-county affairs to the Provincial Councils, the constitution of the Central Council was reduced by about one-third, and the counties were relieved of the incidence of expense. The Central Council now consists of a President (who may hold office for not more than three successive years), two Trustees, four representatives from each of the Irish provinces, and one each from the Colleges and Handball Councils, and the G.A.A. in Britain. Of the four provincial delegates, one is the Provincial Chairman for the year, and three chosen at annual convention, The Secretary- ship of the Central Council is now a permanent office, the holder of which also acts as manager of Croke Park and Secretary of the Association as a Registered Company. t- The GAA.

In view of the \nnotes we have quoted from the lndevenclent and from \nthe Weekly Freeman, it is perhaps only fair to g_ive t~e \nfollowing from the official organ : -\" The D~bhn F~is \nproves amongst other t~ings that the ~eague m Dubhn \nis very much alive,-ahve not _merely m the se~1se that \nit ca-n astonish the public by a huge demonstration once \na year, but in the sense tha~ it is working all the \nwhile, that it is actually producmg spea~ers_ and readers \nand writers of the language.\" As the JUmor reporters \nsay, comment is· needless. The organ that tapped t~e \ncriminal street blackguards on the. back and t~at is \nlikewise a \"confrere \" of the official organ, said: -\n\" No one who attended the Dublin Feis last Sat~tr?ay \ncould fail to be struck with the improvement exh~bited \n• in practically all the competitions.'' An~ agam : -\n\" The concert at night was one of th~ best Insh concerts \nrecently given in Dublin. The audience was large, ~ut \nit should have been even larger.\" Our re'.1-ders, with­\nout any suggestion from us, can make then· own com­\nments. The fight before the League three _months ago \nwas enough to try the strongest !1eart ; smce ~he~ a \nweak Executive has in a sense alhed the Orga~usat~on \nwith street blackguardism, and the consequ~ut situation \nis anything but encouraging. '!'he ~xecutiv~ has _been \ntried and has been found wantrng ; 1t remams for the \n.6.r-o fe1r to take the League out of the gutter. \nvVe have received cheque for £3 for the ~anguage \nFund from Father Fuller, P.P., of ~ 'allybumon, Co. \nK .

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

But all that is gone long since. Even as far\nback as the nineties, when as many as twenty-one men\naside played, there were not wanting signs of develop-\nment on the scientific side. Later on, when the game\nwas confined to seventeen players aside, it became more\nand more a trial of skill, as in the famous Kerry y.\nKildare matches, and, finally, when the number was\nreduced to fifteen aside, Science became the order of\nthe day.",
