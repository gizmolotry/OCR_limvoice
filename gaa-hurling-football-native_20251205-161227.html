I remember Tull playing an All-Ireland Football\nFinal with Clare against Wexford in 1917. He was then only a mere\nlad. Silvy played with London Irish, and kept up the family reputation\nin the city of the Big Fog. Brendan saw his best days in Dublin with\nthe Geraldines and Collegians, although as a boy he had helped Clare\nin their first All-Ireland hurling final away back in 1914. I frequently\nmeet Brendan in my travels, and he is still the same genial personality,\ntaking’ as keen an interest as ever in the games of the Gael. His last\nappearance on the field was against Tipperary in Cork, for the 1930\nMunster Final. Tull made history, in the sensational Clare-Galway clash\nat Limerick for the 1932 All-Ireland Hurling Semi-final. And I must\nnot forget to mention three others of the family, less known to fame,\nbut like their brothers, a trio of workers who gave noble service in the\ncause of native games. Pat was captain of the London Dalcassians and\nkept the game going amongst the exiles in London. Joe, who has\nwritten some beautiful lyric poetry, also wielded a stout caman and\nplayed inter county junior for Dublin, whilst Diarmuid, the youngest\nlimb of the family tree, was also prominent in junior Metropolitan\nhurling nearly thirty years ago.",

A pair of solid iron bowls, about twenty-eight ounces each in weight, form the sole requirements. Given a quiet road with a moderately good surface, two young men on the look-out for a healthy and fas- cinating day's pleasure can start away at once. They start from an appointed mark, keeping a look-out for passers-by, and agree to finish at a familiar gate-pillar, at a cross-roads, or at a farmer's house—whatever comes the handiest—say half a mile ahead. Each throw, the object being to send the bow! as far along the road as possible. They start the second throw from the end of the first, and so on, the man who gets to the score’s end in the least number of throws winning. Generally, however, a match is made, and there are two partners against two opposing partners. This gives increased zest to the game, as co-operation is essential to success then, and the glorious uncertainty is doubled. Generally there is a small bet on the score, but as score follows score usually with varying success, very little is lost or won, But big stakes are occasionally played for between first-class players, and between champions of different baronies or different towns, and on these occasions the enthusiasm and the excitement of the respective followers know no bounds. The roads are black with people, and occa- sionally unpleasant scenes occur. It is here the necessity for control comes in—but of this more anon.",

Surely such a\ngame, which, in spite of adverse laws and without even the\nsemblance of a board of control, continues to fascinate\nthousands weekly in our largest county, iS deserving of some\nattention and of a short space at least in the ANNUAL of our\nGaelic pastimes.",

One of my earliest recollections is to listen with all the fervid interest of childhood to a very old man in my neighbourhood, when referring to the decadence of these later days, tell of how the young men of his time divided their year’s play between “three menths’ bowling and nine months’ goaling.” I wished I lived in those days!

Of the enchanted “Fachna” who could threw as “long a bowl” up a hill as down, and whom no man living had the courage to play a score against.

A communique issued by \nthe Chief Secretary Edward Shortt on 16 May 1918 referred vaguely \nto the 'association between Sinn Fein and the Germans'. The statement \nfinished with a profound declaration that 'the Irish Government are \ndetermined to take every necessary step to stamp out this German Plot'. \nOn the basis of this spurious claim, most of the leadership of the \nVolunteers and Sinn Fein were arrested on 17 and 18 of May. Among \nthose that were arrested were Eamon de Valera, Countess Markievicz, \nArthur Griffith, Darrell Figgis, Joseph McGuinness, Joseph McGrath \nand William T Cosgrave. In total 73 leading members of Sinn Fein and \nthe Volunteer Movement were arrested. The Limerick Chronicle of 31 \nMay 1918 records that police under Sergeant McCarthy raided the City \nPrinting Works in Rutland Street in search of 'material relative to the \nalleged German Plot'. Nothing of an incriminating matter was found but \nthe raid seemed to reflect the manner in which the authorities seemed to \nbe clutching at straws to justify their course of action. \nAs the impact of the arrests began to take effect the public perception \nin Ireland began to see the moves by the authorities as a cynical if clumsy \nattempt to remove the leadership of Sinn Fein and the Republican \nMovement. The ultimate losers were going to be the Irish Nationalist Party \nand as the summer of 1918 unfolded a number of them began to realise \nthis. The ham-fisted policies of the British Authorities, in Ireland, were \n195 T p C 1m at oogan,De Valera-Long Fellow, Long Shadow, (London 1993) p.110 \nRe-organisation, Dissension and the Threat of Conscription 1917-1918 185 \ngoing to make it more and more difficult for them in any future electoral \ncontest with Sinn Fein. In August 1918 a number of them took issue \nwith Mr Shortt in the House of Commons. Joe Devlin, the Nationalist \nMP for West Belfast, and one of the few Nationalist Party MPs who \nwas still in touch with his electorate, declared that the 'German Plot was \nthe outcome of the imagination of the Chief Secretary'. In the course \nof his speech Devlin declared that he believed that the administration \nwas trying to solve the Irish Qyestion by getting rid of the 'present Irish \nrepresentatives'. Devlin prophetically reminded the house that 'something \nmore than speech might be expected from their successors'.196 \n196 Limerick Leader Files October 1918",

This decision was influenced by what \nthey believed was a move for change occasioned by the response to the \nexecutions of 1916. The intervention of Edward Thomas O'Dwyer the \nCatholic Bishop of Limerick had given a respectability to Republican \naspirations that it might not otherwise have had. \nThe candidate chosen to represent Sinn Fein, Count George Plunkett, \nwas the 66-year-old father of one of the executed signatories of the \n1916 procla111ation. The Roscommon By-election provided a brilliant \nfocus and platform for the Sinn Fein organisation just as many of its \nmost prominent members were emerging from internment. In the \nevent Plunkett was victorious by 3,022 votes to Devine's 1708 votes \nwith Tully tailed off in third place with 687 votes. By any measure it was \na resounding victory and it proved to be the shot in the arm that the \nRepublicajn Movement and Sinn Fein was seeking. Patrick O'Connell \nof Foynes gives a very interesting insight into the impact of Plunkett's \nvictory in the west Limerick area. A huge bonfire was lit in Foynes \nvillage and the Sinn Fein supporters celebrated by singing nationalist \nsongs well into the night. Eleven men were arrested and charged with \n'lighting and making use of a fire in the neighbourhood of Foynes \nwithout permission of the competent Naval or Military authority'.

His solicitor was Mr Hugh O'Brien-Moran and \nin the course of his defence of James Ryan, O'Brien-Moran quoted \nfrom some documents which were considered confidential by the police \nauthorities.200 The documents that he quoted from stated that the RIC \nwere instructed to pay for admission to matches, if requested to do so. 201 \nWhile O'Brien-Moran was technically correct the fact was that he was \nquoting from documents that he was not entitled to be in possession of. \nAs a consequence O'Brien-Moran found himself charged with being in \npossession of confidential documents and of failing to reveal how he came \nto be in possession of these documents. He was also tried by court-martial \nat Richmond Barracks in Dublin in January 1917 and, despite a very \nable defence, mounted by Tim Healy and John Power, Hugh O'Brien-\n199 Weekly Observer 28 April 1917 \n200 Hugh O'Brien-Moran (1886-1950) was a son of James Hishon Moran a Solicitor with \nstrong nationalist credentials.James H Moran had himself been jailed during the Land \nWar for making a seditious speech at Ballyneety in 1889. The older Moran was a close \nfriend of William O'Brien, who was unmarried and stood as Godfather to Moran's son, \nhence the O'Brien which was used as a form of Christian name. Hugh O'Brien Moran \nwent on to become the State Solicitor for the Limerick area.

It was actions such as these, where it was felt that ordinary \nRIC men had acted with unwarranted arrogance that contributed to the \nostracisation of the police and their families as much as any politically \nmotivated actions.202 When O'Brien-Moran's arrived back in Limerick \non 23 March, he was accorded a very enthusiastic welcome by a large \ncrowd. Indeed a demonstration against the police by some of the crowd \nlater led to fu;ther court charges. 203 \nOn 9 May 1917 Sinn Fein contested a by-election in Longford South. As \nwas the case in Roscommon Longford South had been an uncontested \nconstituency since 1892 and effectively whilst the ordinary people of \nIreland might have gained the vote in 1884 204 they rarely got a chance \nto exercise it because the Nationalist Party candidate was rarely \nchallenged. The Nationalist Party candidate was a man named Patrick \nMcKenna and Sinn Fein had nominated Joseph McGuinness who \nwas at that stage serving time in prison. The slogan that the Sinn Fein \norganisers used was one of 'Put him in - to get him out'. The slogan \nseemed to catch on and it galvanised McGuinness's campaign. In the \nevent Sinn Fein won the election by the very narrow margin of 32 \nvotes. On the evening that the election result was announced there \nwere widespread celebrations throughout the country. In Ballylanders \nthe Volunteers used the occasion to have a full-scale mobilisation \nof the local company and some of the other neighbouring volunteer \ncompanies. The parade culminated in a torchlight procession through \nthe village.

It was the innocent older people who bore the brunt of the \nassault. When the stone throwers had retreated to a safe distance they \nretaliated. Volley after volley of stones rained down on the police two \nof whom, Constable John Reynolds and Constable Bernard O'Brien, \nreceived fairly severe head injuries. Eventually Inspector Craig loudly \ncalled out 'fix bayonets and charge'. Michael Qµirke states that at this \nstage Jim 'Simon' Scanlon actually fired six shots with a revolver. This \nit seems caused consternation in the police ranks and they retreated \nback towards their barracks.206 It appears that at this juncture Inspector \nCraig ordered the police to prepare to open fire. Fortunately wiser \ncounsels prevailed and Hugh O'Brien-Moran, solicitor for the defence, \nwas among those who appealed to the crowd for order. Eventually after \nbeing addressed by Liam Manahan the crowd relented and withdrew \nsufficiently to allow the police to emerge with their prisoners and \ntake them to Limerick Jail. The police decided to travel by Tipperary \nbecause there was a fear that they might be ambushed if they went \nby Garryspillane and Knocklong. 207 The two most severely injured \n206 Unpublished statement of Michael Qyirke of Corderry, Galbally \n207 U npublished memoirs ofJohn Joe Crawford ofBallylanders \nBy-elections and Prison Terms 1917-1919 191 \npolicemen were to claim compensation for their injuries. Reynolds208 \nand O'Brien received £10 and £35 respectively2°9• \nLater the same year Ned Tobin and John Fogarty of the Glenbrohane \nCompany were arrested for being caught in possession of a pistol. Tobin \nin his statement maintained that it was an old pistol and of no practical \nuse yet it was sufficient grounds for having himself and Fogarty sent \nto Cork for trial. Constable Cullen of Ballylanders gave evidence for \nthe Prosecution. When challenged by Tobin as to whether he himself \nwould be able to kill someone with the pistol the constable had to admit \nthat the weapon was not capable of killing anyone. On the basis of this \nadmission both Tobin and Fogarty were released and returned home \nin triumph. \nThroughout 1917 and 1918 the police authorities continued a form of \npetty harassment intended to keep the Volunteers distracted. This form \nof harassment generally took the form of arrests and charges on relatively \nminor issues but it was beginning to form a pattern of serious division \nbetween the RIC and their families and their nationalist neighbours. \nIn October 1917 Ned Punch of Frederick Place in Limerick city was \ntried for the unsuccessful attack on two RIC men Constables Lavelle \nand O'Sullivan on 16 September of that year. Punch, along with two \nother volunteers, had held up the two policemen at Ballinacurra in an \neffort to disarm them. Apparently the revolver they used for the hold \nup was faulty and when the two policemen resisted, the hold up had to \nbe aborted and Punch and his companions tried to make their escape. \nUnfortunately, for Punch, it appears that the RIC men identified him \nas the slowest of the three and they managed to catch up with him \nand affect his arrest. Punch was later tried before a court-martial in \nDublin in which W E Wylie prosecuted. Punch refused to recognise \nthe court and he was sentenced to five years penal servitude. However, \nhe was released in November 1917, under the 'Cat and Mouse' Act, \nafter serving a little over six weeks of his sentence. This Act allowed the \n208 Constable Reynolds later left the RlC and was ordained to the priesthood. \n209 Limerick Leader 06 October 1919",

They \nwould signal this information to Treacy when they arrived at Knock.long. \nHogan meanwhile had been placed on the evening train at Thurles \nrailway station. His escort consisted of a sergeant and three constables. \nSergeant Peter Wallace, who had been in charge of the raiding party that \ncaptured Hogan at Annfield on Monday morning, was in charge of the \nescort. Constables Jeremiah Ring and John O'Reilly had also been part \nof the raiding party at Annfield. The fourth member of the escort was \nConstable Michael Enright, a native ofLickadoon near Ballyneety, who \nhad been on leave in Limerick over the week-end and had just returned \nto duty on Monday morning. Enright was the only one of the escort \nactually stationed at Thurles. The other three were based at Roskeen \nalthough O'Reilly and Ring were only on temporary secondment on \naccount of the imposition of Martial Law. Hogan and his escort were \nsituated in the first carriage in a compartment backing on to the engine. \nHogan was seated with his back to the engine with Michael Enright on \nhis inside and Sergeant Wallace on the outside close to the door. Ring \nand O'Reilly sat on the opposite seat with their rifles in the upright \nposition. Wallace and Enright had revolvers drawn. \nWhen the unarmed Galbally men had gone to Emly Treacy broke \nhis own party into two groups to avoid attracting attention. Breen and \nRobinson cycled together to Knock.long. Their responsibility being to \ncover the exit and to ensure that the train did not pull out until a rescue \nwas completed. Treacy and Ned O'Brien, both armed with revolvers \nwere to constitute the main rescue party. To add a further complication \nto Treacy's plan they could not predict the exact time of arrival of the \nupward evening train from Cork to Dublin. Sometimes the two trains \nmet at Knock.long and sometimes the Dublin train arrived before the \nCork train. Neither could they predict if there would be armed police \nor military on either train. As it transpired the Cork train arrived in \nstation and departed from Knock.long just as the Dublin train arrived. \nA party of police from Galbally had alighted from the Cork train and \nmade their way from the station. Fortunately for Treacy's plans they \nwere well on the road to Galbally when the Dublin train arrived. It \n1he Rescue at Knocklong and its Aftermath 227 \nwas 7.45 pm,when Treacy and O'Brien arrived in Knock.long. They had \nspotted the Galbally RIC and stayed out of their way as they waited for \nthe Dublin train. They still had 20 minutes to while away and Treacy \nsent O'Brien in search ofThomas Shanahan, to see if any telegrams had \nbeen received. As it transpired Shanahan had received a telegram from \nMay Moloney, but as he had not been appraised by Davy Burke, the \ntelegram mystified him as it also happened, by coincidence, to overlap \nwith his ctwn private dealings in greyhounds. He handed over the \ntelegram that read 'greyhound in Thurles still'. This meant that Hogan \nwas not on the train. \nBy the time O'Brien got back to the station Shanahan arrived with a \nfresh telegram but at that stage the Dublin train could be seen coming \ndown the line. When the train arrived in the station John Joe O'Brien \njumped on to the platform and pointed out, to his brother and Treacy, \nthe carriage and compartment that Hogan and his escort were in.262 \nTreacy then drew his revolver and followed by O'Brien and the unarmed \nGalbally men they entered the carriage. When they threw open the door \nof the compartment the police were taken completely by surprise and it \nlooked for a second as if the rescue would be bloodless. Enright, who was \nseated inside Hogan, appeared to menace the prisoner with his revolver \nand both Treacy and O'Brien fired simultaneously. Michael Enright, a \n35-year-old, single man, dropped dead as he was shot through the heart. \nThis has often been a point of contention that the IRA men opened fire \nwithout reason but the statement of District Inspector McLean, who \ninvestigated the case, stated that Enright sought to 'restrain Hogan'. \nIt was admitted, in the same statement, that when challenged to put \nhis hands up Sergeant Wallace replied 'not likely'.263 Following the \nshooting a tremendous struggle ensued between Sergeant Wallace and \nSean Treacy for possession of the sergeant's service revolver because \nTreacy had lost his own at the start of the fracas. \nThe efforts of others to get involved or to give assistance were \nconstrained by the lack of space in the compartment and the corridor \n262 W/S 1647 Witness Statement ofJohn Joe O'Brien (Bureau of Military History) p.9 \n263 County 904/41 (British National Archives, Kew)",
