Hence, if the right-full goes out to\nsave, the left-full drops in between him and goal, and\nvice versd on the left side. Otherwise the play is very\nmuch the same.

In such localities there appears to be an idea\nabroad that the main thing for every player to do is to\n“‘mind,”” “‘watch,’” and ‘‘go for’ his opponent every\ntime, and if one cannot get the ball oneself, tackle\none’s opponent anyhow, rules notwithstanding, so that\nthe man in possession for the moment may not be able\nto get in his kick. It need hardly be said that tactics\nof this kind do not make for scientific play, and, if\nmatches are marred by the adoption of such crude\nmethods, the fault should not be laid at the door of\nthe framers of the rule which allows a player to field\nthe leather, but forbids an opponent to catch the man\nin possession or charge him from behind.",

The Greeks realised the danger, and,\nalthough outnumbered by ten to one, they\nassembled their united forces under Miltiades,\nand engaged the Persians in what was, perhaps,\none of the most momentous battles in Europe.",
