In a \ntruthful analysis \ntheir music \nmaybe too dis­\ntinct for a self \ncontented local \nmusic scene. They are destined for much greater things. \nThe original line up of the band was formed in early '95 with \nGary Cooper on vocals. Their present vocalist and former gui­\ntarist Steve Fitz tells me that they originally started w ith a \nmelodic metal sound and following this, a string of early suc­\ncesses including reaching the semi-final of a local band com ­\npetition. They promptly recorded their first demo in Xeric stu­\ndios during the Summer of '96 with everyone contributing to \nthe bass tracks due to the· absence of a bass player. \nPossibly their greatest achievement though was the recording \nin Dublin of their perennial epic \"Starscorned\" included on the \nIrish metal compilation. This release gave the band the desired \nexposure which they backed up with a promotional gig in \nDublin venue, Slattery's where Steve explains they were very \nwell received. That was a hectic day for the band with appear­\nances in both Limerick and Dublin. They started with the music \nexpo in Arthur's Quay Park joined by over twenty other Limerick \nbands. These events were to be a turning point for the band \nwho realised their true potential would be found in a change of \nstyle. The departure of Gary Cooper m~ant Steve Fitz becan:ie \nthe band's vocalist. The current line-up Is as follows, Steve Fitz \nis on vocals, Alan O 'Connell on guitar, Sean O 'Brien on bass \nand Keith McCoy on drums. \nSteve attributes the diverse musical influences, ranging from \nFaith No More to Cannibal Corpse, to the line-up change . It \nwould therefore be difficult to pigeon hole the band's music due \nto the many complexities involved, but somehow I would \ndescribe it as improvised, operatic metal. \nThere are however many certainties about the band, for exa~­\nple their music's intoxicating nature and als? the fact that their \ndrummer Keith McCoy is without exaggeration one of the best \ndrummers I have ever seen or heard perform. \nAs well as older songs such as \"Starscorned\" and \"My _ Velvet \nCreation\" their current repertoire includes new songs like the \npowerful \"Cutting Edge\" and even a few acoustic numbers such \nas \"Sometimes\". With this whole new element a successful \ncomeback seems assured when play Costelloe's on \nWednesday, July 8th. \"My Friend Judas\". playing a_s support \nshould make he night a worthy of a mark m _y~ur ~Iary. \n\"As far as playing in Limerick, you're pretty limited , says Steve, \n\"There is definitely a lack of proper venues, bands should be \ndrop21 \ncatered for more professionally\" \nJudging by their musical credentials alone and not on any other \npretence , this Mysteries End gig is not to be missed by any \nself-respecting music lover. The band intend to record the per­\nformance for demo purposes. They will try and capture the \nessence of live performances on the recording -something that \nis difficult to convey in studio demos . This should help bring \nincreased recognition of the band's progression since the \nadvent of new material and the recent line-up change. \n\"Limrock\" continues, so catch it while it's hot. \nMysteries End play with My Friend Judas, July the eighth at \nCostelloe's. Admission is free and the doors open at eight o' \nclock. \nIf you are in a local band and would like to be included in the \n\"Limrock\" profiles send information, contact numbers and /or a \ndemo for the band to DROP Magazine 67-68 Catherine Street \nLimerick. \nThe first of a number of features on essential releases \nof the 1990's by Ollie Gleeson ..... \n\" . \n-■a~ \n....,..;,,,,;-.,.,,...._/·\\:r · . \n/ ' .. ;' - • • • • dl99J't:rt:i1r~·~c., \n,.!,_·, ,· •.•.• ... __:•_ •• :. , ,;f, . \nCRACKER : KEROSENE HAT. \nWhen David Lowery's 'Camper Van Beethoven' crashed on tour \nin 1989, he needed a new vehicle to carry his skewed philoso­\nphy to the world. To this end he set up Cracker with his long \ntime friend John Hickman. From 1992 to 1996 they released \nthree albums: Cracker, Kerosene Hat and·The Golden Age but \nin a sense Cracker's 'golden age' arrived with the release of \nKerosene Hat. \nLowery never lost the eccentricities of his Camper Van days \nand this is obvious by the fact that this CD carries an amazing \n99 tracks, most of which however consist only of three sec­\nonds of silence. Lost amongst the static is track 88, Eurotrash \nG irls with a wit and a chorus which will stay with you long \nafter.Pee Pee and Poo Poo have gone to bed. The two singles \n\"Low\" and \"Get Off This\" along with the caustic \"Movie Star'' are \ngrunge laden and paranoid yet rest comfortably alongside the \ninfectious country nonsense of \"Sweet Potato\" and the epic gui­\ntar ballad \"I Want Everything\" (what Counting Crows' \nWalkaways would sound like if they ever finished it.) Throw in a \nGrateful Dead cover i.e. \"Loser'' and a 40 second slice of distor­\ntion i.e. Hi-Desert Biker Meth Lab (basically some nutter with a \nhammer who falls asleep!) and you have one of the most \nessential albums of the Nineties. @)",

          "text": ": I an emotional fish \nKnown to many as the band who wrote the song \"Celebrate\" An Emotional Fish performed \nin the Warehouse recently where they showed exactly what else they could play. DROP \nreporter, Micheal Duffy went along to the show and spoke to the lads •••••••• \nDuring the first half of the 90's,An Emotional Fish were \none of the leading lights of the Irish music scene, synonymous \nwith great live shows and their big hit which still gets a regular \nairing on radio, 'Celebrate'. \nHowever after a couple of great singles from their third \nand last album 'Sloper', they slowly slipped from the limelight \nand out. the back door of the attention hotel. \nYet you felt a band who perform so enthusiastically on \nstage could not resist the lure of the live circuit for too long \nand sure enough Ger Whelan and the boys are back on the \nroad, and visited Limerick's newest live venue, The Warehouse \non Friday June 19th. \nRelaxing backstage before the gig, Whelan explained the \nbands notable absence of late. \"Basically, we weren't enjoying it \nat the time, and we felt we weren't doing what we wanted to \ndo. The corporate influences were a bit strong and things \nkinda came to a halt.\" \nBreaking free of the corporate shackles, Whelan is \nrivalling in the bands new role. \"I was fed up being the clown, \nnow I want to be the ringmaster\". \n\"We're fishing in the back waters at the moment, taking \na different approach. Our familiar songs are going to sound dif­\nferent live, and there will be a nucleus of \nesting for us and the audience.\" \nComeback tours are often a trip down memory lane, \nbut not this one. \"Some new material is already recorded and \nwe will be playing a lot of it at the gigs. We've also recorded an \nElvis cover for a charity album so listen out for that.\" \nThe .easy going atmosphere back stage was very appar­\nent as the -boys took to the stage. Kieran Kennedy, another \nfamilar face from the early nineties replaced guitarist Dave \nFrew for the gig and slotted in with ease. Right from the styl­\nish beginning of separately introducing \"our compare for the \nevening\" (Ger Whelan of course), the band performed with \nconfidence and surety, making it simple for the crowd to enjoy. \nIts clear to see that this is what An Emotional Fish do, \nand enjoy, best. Whelan comes alive on stage, a born frontman \nwhose enthusiasm and showmanship spreads to involve the \ncrowd. \nAll the new tracks went down well, especially \"A.F.C. \nWake up call\" ( the T-rex influence certainly noticeable), while \ndrop16 \nold favourites like_ 'Rain' and \"Blue' jogged \nthe memory. \nThe crowd waited for 'Celebrate' and \nwere not disappointed. The drum'n'bass \nversion teased, before the band obliged \nwith the more familiar version. The crowd \npredictably, celebrated. \nComebacks are often ridiculed, out of \nretirement as a means to an end is the \ngeneral consensus. An Emotional Fish dis­\nregard the cliches, and just delight in the \nfact that they are back, playing to what will \nbe appreciative crowds if the Limer:ick gig \nis anything to go by. @",

Nigeria's defeat \nof Spain barely qualifies as Nigeria have been a dom­\ninant force in African football for many years now and \ndeclared to the world their intentions of kicking \nInternational ass back in USA '94 when they made it \nto the quarter finals. That's about it really .. unless you \ncount Iran beating the USA by two goals to one. Also \nthe days when the USA could be considered a Goliath \nof International football are many summers away. \nOtherwise any of the teams that one might have liked to \nsee topple one of the big boys have disappointed us as \nwell as themselves. Scotland showed that they simply don't \nhave it in crucial areas of the field. Their defence was too \nslow and tired by the time the nifty little Moroccans made \nshreds of it and the Scots lacked any cohesive punch up \nfront either. Jamaica's Reggae Boyz showed that all the \nheart and will to win in the World won't help if your team \nlacks basic football cop -on. Although they weren't \nhelped by a fussy ref dismissing one of their players early \non in their dash with Argentina. \nThere might be substance to the theory that there's one law \nfor the big boys and another law for the underdogs in that \nI've seen several minor image tackles -two by Italians, one \nby the English and another Brazilian one -totally ignored \nby the officials. \nCameroon, I thought had considerably less luck tan they \nhad talent. Though well beaten by the Italians they could \nand should have secured a place in the second round but \nhad what looked like a legitimate goal, disallowed in their \n1-1 draw with Chile. Consequently it will have been an \ndrop18 \nadmittedly useful looking Chile who had the snot kicked off \nthem by Brazil last Saturday week (I'm sticking my head \nout here again ... l'm writing this on the Wednesday prior to \nthe Chile Vrs Brazil game .) \nSo by the time this brand new \"DROP\" is piping hot off the \npress we'll be down to the last fo~r and the usua~ s~spects \nare already lining up to book their places and this Is \nbefore the group stage is over at all. \nDespite their Norwegian hiccup, I expect that Brazil will \nstill be there which will mean that they fought off Nigeria's \nSuper Eagles at the quarter finals stage. Italy being the \npoxy shower of gits that they' re will probably still be there \ntoo via a few penalty shoot outs -probably dumping the \nexciting host team of France out at the same stage. I'd like \nto think that my pre-tournament bet, Holland will still be \nthere too though they'll have to cross swords with their old \nnemesis the Germans en route. \nAt this point in time the team looking most likely to go all \nthe way from what I've seen, is Argentina. This I don't \nmind at all as I'll have £35 coming to me in a gentleman's \nwager if the Argies go all the way . They've shown that \nthey've the right blend of South American flair, North \nEuropean robust tackling and Mediterranean acting skills \nessential for winning those free kicks-to take them to the \nfinals. Also they have at least two lads, Batistuta and \nOrtega who know how to stick a ball in the back of the net \nand with frightening regularity as poor auld Jamaica will \ntestify. \nAnd finally what of England?? Sure haven't I just said \nArgentina will be there so we'll have waved bye bye to \nGlen Hoddle's boys at the airport quite a while ago.

Now for those of us who love \nGrand Prix racing but have so far been entirely unsuccessful \nin attracting the collective eye of Formula One's various team \nmanagers or in even acquiring the very basic necessity of an \nFIA approved racing-licence this might just be a case of Ron \nDennis and Co . (the head guy at you know who) making our \nstep up from super-mini to super-car that bit easier. Why so? \nWell, because Mclaren, in all their glorious Mercedes funded \nwisdom, have decided that a certain member of the anony­\nmous public shall get a chance to strap themselves into this \ncar, to hold on tight and to get hurled around Silverstone in \nwhat has to be the world's most expensive taxi and all with­\nout he or she footing any sort of bill, tab or debt. \nIn association with Autosport magazine (avail­\nable from Easons of Patrick street or Gleesons of Glentworth \nstreet) Mclaren are running a simple postal competition \nwhereby we -the anonymous public -buy a copy of \nAutosport, write our name and address onto a specially \nenclosed postcard (which the magazine supplies), mail the \npostcard and hey presto a couple of weeks later Mika \nHakkinen rings up telling us we've won the trip of a life time \nand that Ron Dennis is looking forward to our visit. Couldn't \nbe more simple. Then again so is the Lotto but as yet I \nhaven't had any call to celebrate that either. Yet I'd be a fool \nto discount chance entirely, certain Satanic Cults and dodgy \nSooth Sayers have promised that with enough self mutilation, \ndegradation and the odd large donation to their always \nshort of the final figure building funds, our prayers, or \nshould that not be our post cards, will be answered. With \nwhat though, junk mail from Mclaren H.Q. entreating us to \ncomfort disappointment with a David Coulthard lamp shade \nor even a Mika Hakkinen commemorative soup ladel? I don't \nthink so. The fact of the matter is I stand the same chance as \neveryone else in this competition, which when the Abacus of \nLife finally Rickers to a standstill works out as pretty much \ndiddly squat. \nNo, despite all my admiration for Ron and his team's \nwacky two seater, I can't bring myself to enter his generously \noffered competition. Its one thing not to win a million squids \nevery third or fourth evening, but to have my one and only \nchance of ever sitting behind the wheel of an active contem­\nporary Formula One car (well I would be behind the driver \nand he'd be in front of the wheel) missing out on something \nas cool as this would be too much. Much too much . I'd pre­\nfer to read about John Nobody from Nothingham who \n'SUCCEEDED IN LAST WEEKS COMPETITION, WELL \nDONE JOHN' and to sit back in the sure knowledge that I \nwasn't in so I couldn't have won. And not being in I could \nhave no regrets, and having no regrets would ensure I \ncould forget the whole matter and in so forgetting I could \ncarry on with my life almost perfectly ignorant of that which \nI could never have had in the First place - a trip 'round the \nblock in a Mclaren. Now you may take exception to my \nlogic, you may even disagree with my pessimism, but I'd \nwager a month of \nyou're own income that no one from Limerick is going to \nwin. I guess, when all is said and won, this is just another \ncase of God awful post-modern rationalist thinking over­\ncoming my latenf lateral madcapness. I almost feel sorry for \nmyself. But for those of you with a bit more Romance in \nyou' re bones don't forget its Autosport Easons and \nGleesons and its off the shelves come Friday.

Back then Ireland was at the centre of this \nwonderful sport. Sean Kelly was always in the world's top \ntwo world cycling rankings. Roche had his record equalling \ntrilogy of wins in 1987. Martin Early was arguably the finest \nnon team leader cycling at the time and Paul Kimmage was \nblossoming into a fine professional rider. \nToday there is no Irish rider in the Continental Pro Peloton, Roche \nand Kelly have joined the list of former greats. Martin Early has \nbecome a mountain bike rider. Paul Kimmage is a journalist iso­\nlated from the sport he loves because of his courage to write a \nbook highlighting the dominance of drugs in cycling. The \nFederation of Irish cycling is a highly politicised body with \ndisharmony never too far from the surface. However the FIC has \na charismatic president in Pat McQuaid, the man who has done \nthe most to bring the Tour De France to Ireland. \nMcQuaid and Alan Ruston, his partner in L'Evenement (The com ­\npany organising the Tour in Ireland), have managed to secure \nfor Ireland it's biggest sports event ever. They were assisted by \nthe Dublin International Sports Council and also by the govern­\nment in making a case to have the tour here. Another important \nfactor was the support of the current race director, Jean Marie \nLeblanc, who covered the Nissan Classic in 1985 and 1986, \nhere he \"saw a lively race in a part of the world he hadn't seen \nbefore\". \nThe Tour will begin in Dublin on the 11th of this month with a \nPrologue (Time Trial) which will start outside Trinity College. It \nwill then weave its way through Nassau street, Stephen's Green \nand under Christ Church before finishing outside the GPO . This \nis a short circuit and a good braking will be as important as \nspeed for the riders here. \nStage one takes place the following day and will stretch over a \ndistance of 180.5km. It will begin at the GPO, but will be neu­\ntralised until Dundrum, here the real start commences. The Tour \nthen travels down to Arklow before turning up to Avoca, \nBlessington and Tallaght and it will finish up in the Pheonix park \nat around 4pm, 4 hours and 2o minutes after its start. \nThe second stage will leave Enniscorthy at 9am and travel along \nthe South coast during the 205.5 KM journey. This is an \nextremely difficult stage which encorporates the Sean Kelly sprint \nwhich will happen just after the climb of Carrick-on-Suir. The \nstage finishes at Victoria Cross in Cork. This stage should set the \nscene for the dominant riders to emerge. These riders include, \nRilis and Ullrich the winners of the last two tours. Then there are \nthe climbers like Zulle who is very good on the mountains. A fit \nOlano could pose a threat and the race is also very suited to a \nrider like Casagrande and don't forget Jalabert. \nIreland is well set to produce some really good racing according \nto Stephen Roche, \"The roads are narrow but it will be the first \ntime the riders haven't had to deal with round about\" So ironi­\ncally Ireland will have the safest touring roads. The roads should \nEscartin -one of the Tour's Climbers \nalso add excitement to the race because \"they are twisty which \nwill make it difficult for any team to organise a chase.\" Roche \nsaid. \nThere is a whole plethora of facts concerning the size of the tour \nbut if we just consider a few it will reAect the scale of the project. \nThree ships will help to carry the tour back to France from Cork. \nThere are also three chartered planes flying from Cork to Brest on \nthe return journey. There are 3500 accredited race personnel, \n1500 journalists, 200 photographers, 22 teams with nine riders \neach, 40 Gendarmerie assisted by l 000 Gardai and there will \nbe 104 broadcasting units following the race. The tour is expect­\ned to contribute £30 million to the economy. \nWhatever your interest in cycling, the atmosphere surrounding \nthe Tour's Ireland stages is sure to engulf you. So if you want to \nappear wise say convincingly that : \"Cipollini will win the first \nstage and Erik Zabel will win in Cork while Boardman and \nUllrich will do well in the time trial.\".@ \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the tour de france \nin Ireland \ndrop20 \n(",

To this end he set up Cracker with his long \ntime friend John Hickman. From 1992 to 1996 they released \nthree albums: Cracker, Kerosene Hat and·The Golden Age but \nin a sense Cracker's 'golden age' arrived with the release of \nKerosene Hat. \nLowery never lost the eccentricities of his Camper Van days \nand this is obvious by the fact that this CD carries an amazing \n99 tracks, most of which however consist only of three sec­\nonds of silence. Lost amongst the static is track 88, Eurotrash \nG irls with a wit and a chorus which will stay with you long \nafter.Pee Pee and Poo Poo have gone to bed. The two singles \n\"Low\" and \"Get Off This\" along with the caustic \"Movie Star'' are \ngrunge laden and paranoid yet rest comfortably alongside the \ninfectious country nonsense of \"Sweet Potato\" and the epic gui­\ntar ballad \"I Want Everything\" (what Counting Crows' \nWalkaways would sound like if they ever finished it.)

          "text": "~ \n! \n··nds ( . H·: :\"l \nGillian Cha/ke visits the fashion collection on show in \nthe School of Art and Design exhibitions .... \nFor those who missed out on the superb collections which were \npresented at the Limerick School of Art and Design fashion show, \nthere should not have been any excuse this week with the offi­\ncial launch of the Diploma/Degree show. Pieces were on show \nto the public all week, with the bulk of the Fashion, Fine Art and \nsculptures collections on display in the Good Shepherd convent, \nClare Street. It was a haven for the culturally deprived and \nUtopia for those who appreciate \"the finer things in life\". \nThe sense of pride and relief was almost tangible amongst the \ngroup of creators os the hard year's work was finally drawing to o \nclose. The immense assiduity, perseverance, dedication and com­\nmitment to their work was palpable and the evidence was certainly \nthere for the public to delight in, denounce, bewilder, awoken, \nelectrify, luxuriate in and above all BUY. \nThe wide and varied use of fabrics by each individual designer \nwas commendable . Joanne Hynes' \"Skin't\" used o unique flesh \ncoloured material which come from \nthe fashion capitol of the world -\nGoie Paris. This emulated o sec­\nond skin which was then printed \nupon with silver metallic point \ncreating o punk retro look. And \nwith the bum cut out of one of \nthe pieces it certainly created o \nshocking look. Throughout the \nother collections we sow the use \nof lace, natural fibres, plasticised \nMesh, velvet & satin, stretch \nnylon & lycra, shine & texture -\nshantung silk, two-tone fabrics, leather, suede, denim, jersey, tow­\neling. \nThe different themes alone of each individual collection was inspir­\ning. This exhibition belonging to Kirsten French entitled Warhol's \nSisters illuminates how style and fashion mingled with the worlds \nof contemporary fine art and film throughout Andy Warhol's life \nand work. \"Blessed ore the ovont-gorde for they shall inherit the \nearth.\" \nThe body and its depiction in both \no vulnerable yet trashy manner \nwas o common theme through o \nnumber of collections. Oran \nHallinan's DS7-1 was based on \nthe Seven Deadly Sins and their \ndepiction's on the body, an eerie \nmood of unspoken taboos. As \nmentioned earlier Skin't aim was \nto represent anti-established dress \ncodes for those who deliberately \ndress morally incorrect. Her \nfusion of punk D-1-Y style with a touch of glamour set out to shock \nthe conservatives of the world. 'My word you con see that girls \nbottom!.' Go Girl!. Joanne has worked with top designer John \nRocho and is set to assist the up and coming Hussein Chalayan \nthis summer in his London workshop. \nChaloyon is renowned for his canny \ninterpretation of the lace trend such \nos crop tops in a computer generated \ndoily print and lace side seam inserts \nappearing on o leather pencil skirt. \nAs always, details ore all-important. \nAnother young talent to watch out for ,.,, . \nis Alon Kelly who was presented with \non award ot the LS .AD . fashion show. \n36\", 26\", 36\" portrayed Sex Kittens as Sluts {and vice-verso}. Real \nlady, wild woman . \nCustomizing Second hand clothes ploy o huge part in the modern \nfashion world. Buy them os they ore, then customize a new style \nfrom the old, from streetweor to clubwear. Amy Lee's Revamp used \ncontrasting Fabrics to complement each other. Similar techniques \ncan be seen in streetweor shops such os Hype in London, or Se Si in \nDublin. Go out there and creole your own look using what Limerick \nshops have to offer. Luwly Jubbly menswear from Louise Kennedy \nwas just that. Fun, chunky knits, burgundy leatherette bomber jack­\nets and long blazers with the logo embossed in yellow stitching. \nLoud shirts with drainpipe trousers. Go for the \"Del Boy\" look and \nyou can't go wrong. @",

To this end he set up Cracker with his long \ntime friend John Hickman. From 1992 to 1996 they released \nthree albums: Cracker, Kerosene Hat and·The Golden Age but \nin a sense Cracker's 'golden age' arrived with the release of \nKerosene Hat. \nLowery never lost the eccentricities of his Camper Van days \nand this is obvious by the fact that this CD carries an amazing \n99 tracks, most of which however consist only of three sec­\nonds of silence. Lost amongst the static is track 88, Eurotrash \nG irls with a wit and a chorus which will stay with you long \nafter.Pee Pee and Poo Poo have gone to bed. The two singles \n\"Low\" and \"Get Off This\" along with the caustic \"Movie Star'' are \ngrunge laden and paranoid yet rest comfortably alongside the \ninfectious country nonsense of \"Sweet Potato\" and the epic gui­\ntar ballad \"I Want Everything\" (what Counting Crows' \nWalkaways would sound like if they ever finished it.) Throw in a \nGrateful Dead cover i.e. \"Loser'' and a 40 second slice of distor­\ntion i.e. Hi-Desert Biker Meth Lab (basically some nutter with a \nhammer who falls asleep!) and you have one of the most \nessential albums of the Nineties. @)",

Dissension is not a pleasant subject to dwell upon. Fortunately, to-day it is but an unhappy remembrance of other times, and with both ends of the county working in the most complete unanimity the prospects for the future are of the brightest. In Louth it has been long recognised that certain areas require special grading, and in order to encourage teams from the rural districts, the Committee have started an Intermediate Competition. I do not think many other countries have yet discriminated so far between their junior and senior material, but I do know that if the spirit of the Louth County Board’ idea is carried into proper effect, it is bound to have a wholesome influence on the power of the Association in the country districts. County clubs are recruited from such a wide area, have such poor facilities for training and lose players so frequently by emigration’and other causes, that it is impossible to expect them to compete on an equality with their friends from the towns who have their players close at hand, and generally experience little difficulty in procuring training quarters. It was chiefly as an incentive to those clubs that the Louth Board inaugurated this grade, and up to the present it has worked remarkably well.",

It will never extricate our exclusively Irish-Ireland Association from its obligations and responsibilities towards the Industrial Revival. Go into a football field where a match is about to begin—here the writer speaks from his own observations—examine the ball, and it is found to be imported. Examine the footballers’ caps, jerseys, and boots—well, they may be Irish-made, but the chances in favour of their being imported are about four or five to one. Then, again, in the case of athletic sports, no trouble is taken to have Irish decorations in the sports’ field, to have Irish timber in the grand stand (so- called), if there be one erected, and imported wire and timber stakes are used in the fencing of the enclosures and running tracks, in the place of Irish timber stakes and Irish hemp ropes. The outfits of the competitors are imported. In cycling events, it is utterly impos- sible to find competitors on Irish machines! The prizes, generally speaking, are an accumulation of imported rubbish positively not worth a young fellow’s earnest effort. In hand- ball matches, a ball called the “cock and standard” is very popular. This ball is not Irish-made.

It will\nnever extricate our exclusively Irish-Ireland Association from its\nobligations and responsibilities towards the Industrial Revival.\nGo into a football field where a match is about to begin—here\nthe writer speaks from his own observations—examine the ball,\nand it is found to be imported. Examine the footballers’ caps,\njerseys, and boots—well, they may be Irish-made, but the\nchances in favour of their being imported are about four or five\nto one. Then, again, in the case of athletic sports, no trouble\nis taken to have Irish decorations in the sports’ field, to have\nIrish timber in the grand stand (so-called), if there be one\nerected, and imported wire and timber stakes are used in the\nfencing of the enclosures and running tracks, in the place of\nIrish timber stakes and Irish hemp ropes. The outfits of the\ncompetitors are imported. In cycling events, it is utterly impos-\nsible to find competitors on Irish machines! The prizes,\ngenerally speaking, are an accumulation of imported rubbish\npositively not worth a young fellow’s earnest effort. In hand-\nball matches, a ball called the “cock and standard” is very\npopular. This ball is not Irish-made.

Examples \nare : Arkins (0 h Orchain), Conway (0 Connmhaigh), Crowe (MacConchradha), \nGleeson (0 Gliasain), Kett (6 Ceit), Long (6 Longaigh), Sexton (0 Seasnain), \nShine (0 Seighin) and Thynne (6 Teimhin). Others have taken on an English \ntwist, to be seen in the final D and S of Boland and Mullins and in the ham of \nMarkham. Markham (recte Markahan, cf. Ballymarkahan) among surnames, \nlike Rathfarnham (in Irish Rathfearnainn) among place names, is an example \nof surrender to English influence without even the excuse of those who emas­\nculated Glenbehy by calling it Glenbeigh as a concession to the inability of \nEnglish tourists to cope with the letter H between two vowels. \nOf the names mentioned above one or two-e.g., Long and Green-may \nin certain individual cases be not only English in appearance but English in \norigin. They belong to that numerous class of Irish surname the anglicised \nfonn of which is the same as a common English name. Unless family records \nare available, there is no way of knowing for certain whether, for ex.ample, a \nSmith is a MacGowan, a Lane an O Leyne, a Clarke an O Clery and a King a \nMacConry or just the descendant of an English planter called Smith, Lane, \nClarke or King, as the case may be. Cox, Dean, Drew, Fay, Field, Ford, Fox, \nLyons, Kerr and Moore are a few other typical examples. Thomond names of \nthis kind are not numerous : Howard and Sammon may be cited for Co. Clare; \nCollins, Gunning and Lambe are Co. Limerick examples. \nAnother tendency to be noted is the gradual resumption of the prefixes \n0 and Mac. The extent to which these were discarded during the eighteenth \ncentury, when everything Gaelic in Ireland was under a cloud, is perhaps not \nusually recognised. It was in fact only at the beginning of the present cen­\ntury under the growing influence of the Gaelic League that the general reversal \nof this process began to be perceptible. Even to-day there are dozens of Gaelic \nnames with which the prefix is seldom if ever seen, e.g., Crowe (McEnchroe),",

A few, however, such as O Neill and \n0 Brien seldom shed the 0, and in Clare, at any rate, 0 Donnell always \nretained it. For Ireland as a whole the extent of the resumption can best be \nillustrated by the mere fact that while in 1890, according to Matheson's calcu­\nlations, there were twice as many Connells as O Connells, to-day (judging by \nthe test of directories) we have nine O Connells to every Connell. I do not know \nthe present proportion of O Kellys to Kellys, but I am sure it is very much \nhigher than it was in 1890 when Matheson estimates that there were approxi­\nmately 55,900 Kellys in Ireland and only about 400 0 Kellys \nThe following table she,vs the position in this respect regarding the \nname O Sullivan for Limerick.

Clare quite 50% are now called O Halloran. In this connexion it may \nbe remarked here that the use of these voters' lists for this purpose probably \nresults in a considerable underestimate of the extent of the resumption, as in \ngoing through them I noticed several examples of people who appear in the \nregister without the prefix, notw ithstanding the fact that to my own knowledge \nthey do actually use the Mac or 0, as the case may be. \nThe most remarkable case of \"resumption\" is probably O .Gorman. This \nname, so far as Clare is concerned, is really Mac Gorman, but so completely \nwas the Mac dropped in the 18th century that it appears to have been for­\ngotten, and when the Gormans began to re-Gaelicize their patronymic they put \nan O before it instead of a Mac. The first offender 'vvas probably the famous \nChevalier, though it is hard to understand why he, with his antiquarian know­\nledge, can have been guilty of such an error, unless he had some evidence that \nhe himself was actually an O Gorman; for there is, according to Woulfe, such \na name, though it is very rare and apparently unconnected with Thomond. \nAnother example of confusion between Mac and O is to be found in the \nLimerick Mackessy. This, of course, is an O name (6 Macasa), but I find some \nof them calling themselves McKissy : so they are described in the recent voters' \nlists for Limerick City on which I worked. \nThere are also examples not of resumption but of erroneous assumption. \nThe use of the form MacArthur, for example, is quite without• authority so far \nas Ireland, and especially Limerick, is concerned. There are, of course, the \nScottish MacArthurs, but our Arthurs are of Norman origin and it is a. solecism \nand an affectation to prefix the Mac to this name. \n,As Father Woulfe devoted some space to an analysis of the Christian \nNames in use in Co. Limerick in 1914, it might be of interest to bring this up \nto date and also to compare it with a similar examination for Co. Clare. It \nwill be observed that John remains the most popular Christian name, that \nMartin is common in Clare and rare in Limerick, while in a less degree the \nconverse·applies to Denis.

Now the engineer and the architect have supplanted the peasant \nbuilder and another phase of history has come to an end. \nIt is extremely difficult to assess the antiquity of traditional building \nfeatures-. There is usually no evidence of the date of erection of a particular \nhouse, and even in the exceptional cases where the date of building can be_ dis­\ncovered, there is no indication of the time or cause of the origin of the material \nculture-motifs embodied therein. <1) In Ireland building tradition has not deve­\nloped along the lines which it would have taken in a country with a happier \nhistory. Here a centuries-long stagnation was induced by the .oppression and \nexploitation which are the natural concomitants of foreign misgovernment. The \nresult has been the fossilisation of many very archaic features, and the per­\nsistence down to the present day of aspects of building which would have long \nago disappeared under normal conditions. Now that the great· change has \ncome, these are being swept away and it is essential that a record be made of \nthem before they vanish completely. (2) \nFig 8.

A sod wall was not suitable \nfor the application of a weatherproofing surface, and was severely affected by \ndamp and frost. Nevertheless, sod houses were formerly built in the poorer and less favoured parts of the county (see fig. 8). \nThe method employed w as as primitive as the material. The sods \\Vere \ncut from the surface of a field or bog, from which the grass and heather had \nalready been cut or burned, each sod being about three feet long by two feet \nwide, and four to six inches thick. In building the walls the sods were laid with \nthe grass surface up, in courses, the joints broken as in stonework, and \nbeaten firmly down with a spade. Usually there was a foundation consisting \nof a shallow trench filled with loose stones, but sometimes this was dispensed \nwith, and the walls erected on the bare ground. As sod is not suitable for the \nerection of gables, the walls were built to the same height all around-about \nseven feet, and a hip-roof constructed. The rough edges of the door and win­\ndow openings were trimmed with a spade or hay-knife. Door and window \nframes w ere then inserted. Instances are related of sod walls being built \nquite solid and unbroken, and the door and window openings being carved out with a -spade. \nCLAY was used for dwelling house w alls all over the county, and was in \nmost districts the usual building material. The walls were built of a mixture \nof viscous yellow clay and chopped straw or rushes. When well whitewashed \nthese walls were very sound and weatherproof as long as the roof was kept in \nrepair. Where the roof w as neglected or removed, frost and rain rapidly eroded \nthe clay walls and caused them to disappear in a very few years, leaving \nhardly a trace of the former existence of a house on the spot. Clay is a facile \nmaterial, from which relatively large ar.d complex buildings can be erected. On \nthe other hand it is difficult to build a gable of clay, ,vhich means that clay-wall \nand hip-roof usually go together. Here is a verbatim account of the building \nof clay walls by one ,vho took part in it, in 1884. \n\"The neighbours came to give my father a hand with digging and tem­\npering the mud . They dug it out and tempered it by mixing it with shovels, \nlike a woman m ixing dough. It had to be ,veil softened and all the lumps \nbroken and rushes mixed with it. A neighbour came and rode his horse \naround through it to help to mix it. Then it was left under the weather while \nthey were digging the foundations. These were dug about two feet deep and \nlaid with stone, mortared with some of the mud, and the stonework w as built \nup to a height of about a foot above the level of the ground all around, because \nif you built a wall with mud from the ground up, the bottom of the wall would \nahvays be damp . The western end of the house is built with stone up to the \nroof, because that is where the worst of the w eather coines on it. We got the \nlocal mason to do that part of the work , and he laid the stones with some of the \nmud instead of mortar. \n\" While he was raising the west wall, the rest of the men built up the \nmud wall with shovels. They built up about a foot of the w all and walked ' \non top of it to firm it down. Th e next day that course was fairly dry, and \nthey trimm ed it to the right thickness with a spade and put on another course. \nEvery morning they trimm ed the course they had put on the day before.

That part of my \" draft map \" which covers the counties \nembraced in the ancient territory of Thomond is reproduced on page 11. \nFather Woulfe's two articles referred to above dealt only with the \nCounty Limerick. He based his findings on the current (1914) voters' lists \n' wh ich shewed that of the 19,000 persons then registered approximately 14,500 \nhad surnames of native Irish, 2,100 of Norman and 1,700 of English origin (the \nremainder being doubtful or miscellaneous). As I am dealing here with the \ntwo counties of Limerick and Clare, and as the number of vote-rs is now much \ngreater than it was in 1914, I found it impossible in the time at my disposal to \nmake a complete count of the current register for both Clare and Limerick. \nHowever, a count was made for over 50 names in the Co. Clare lists, and I. \nmade considerable use of those for Limerick County and City in other ways as \nwill appear later in this paper. \nAnother authority of a different kind on Irish names is Matheson, who \nwas responsible for producing what is, perhaps, the most interesting \" blue \nbook \"<Z> ever issued by a government in Ireland. Pages 16 to 20 of it may be \ndisregarded, as they are simply a presentation of MacDermott's map in tabular \nform. The chief interest for our present purpose lies in the statistical infor­\nmation compiled from the registrations of births for a selected year (1890). \nUntil I undertook to give the talk on \" Surnames of Thomond,\" which subse­\nquently re~ulted in the writing of this paper, I was inclined to accept the con-· \nclusions which ~atheson based on these official statistics. Taking the number \nof births in the year as indicative of the numerical strength of various names, \nhe found that the following twelve names were the commonest in the country as \na whole : Murphy, Kelly, Sullivan, Walsh, Smith, 0 Brien, Byrne, Ryan, Connor, \nO Neill, Reilly, Doyle. There is no precise way, short of a detailed examina­\ntion of the last census or the voters' lists for the 32 counties to check the accu­\nracy of this list for the present time. A rough and ready test1 however, is to \nbe found in the Telephone Directory for the 26 counties or in Thom's Directory \nof Dublin. Any capital city is, as far· as names are concerned, more or less a \nreflection or microcosm of the whole country. By these tests the position is \nseen to be almost unchanged, the only noticeable difference being that Kennedy \ncomes up into the first dozen and Byrne, as might be expected where Dublin is \nconcerned, rises from seventh to second place. \nIt is somewhat surprising, then, on comparing Woulfe's 1914 figures for \nCo. Limerick with Matheson's to find marked discrepancies in them even whe n \ndue allowance is made for the fact that the latter includes the city and the \nformer does not.

Usually a hght screen of masonry was built to close them, \nbut the independence of the chimney funnel was maintained. The external \nprojection of the chimney is often a massive erection (see fig. 4). \nFLOORS. The floors were usually. of clay.

Our Jacobite officer reports \"The cabins seldom \nhave any floor but the earth . . . . Some have windows, others none.\"(8) Now­\nadays every house has windows of glass-the older ones fixed and not made \nto open-and doors of wood, with the usual half-doors. In many of the older \nhouses a long recess in the wall behind the door held a short beam, which was \ndrawn across the doorway at night and had its end thrust into a socket on the· \nother side, thus securing the door firmly. Some of the old people remember \ndoors made of bundles of furze or heather tied to a frame of sticks and fas­\ntened to this beam when the door was closed. ' Scolpa.n' was the usual term \nfor these door covers, and also for the heavy doors of bog-_oak used in some of \nthe houses. These were made of roughly hewn wood and swung on ' bacain '­\nheavy ir:on hingles made by the local blacksmiths. In some of the poorest \nhouses there were no windows other than mere openings in the wall, into which \nbundles of hay or straw were thrust to keep out the wind. \nDoor and window coverings of wickerwork are mentioned by a traveller \nin County Limerick about the year 1810. .He writes \"As 'I had done in the \nCounty of Kerry and elsewhere, I found in the County of Limerick, the com­\nmon people· extremely fond of wickerwork. Their doors with padlocks, windows, \ncradles, beds, chairs, &c., &c., are in general all of ·neat wickerwork. In one \nhouse I observed a bed of extremely neat wickerwork, sufficient to contain \ntwo grown people, shaped like a cradle, the head jutting out as if it had been \none.\"(9) \nRooFs. Thatch is the material used in houses roofed in the traditional \nmode, and croftsmanship of a high standard was shown in the work of the \nprofessional thatchers. Generally the roofs have a fairly high pitch-about \nfifty-five degrees to the horizontal. Of the houses roofed in the traditional \nmanner, some three-quarters have hip-roofs, the other fourth have peaked \ngables and only two roof surfaces. <,10) \nThe main timbers of the roof take the form of A-shaped principles or \ncouples, each consisting of two rafters and a collar-brace. The rafters are fas­\ntened together at the top, and to the collar-brace by half-joints and wooden tre­\nnails. Usually, about three inches of each rafter projects beyond the joint at \nthe top, making an X-shaped bed in which the roof-tree lies.

      "raw_text": "12 \nresult of criticism by specialists in local history from time to time during the \nnext few years, but even as it is I venture to believe that it is a distinct \nadvance on the last production of its kind, viz., Dr. Philip MacDermott's map, \nmade in 1846. That part of my \" draft map \" which covers the counties \nembraced in the ancient territory of Thomond is reproduced on page 11. \nFather Woulfe's two articles referred to above dealt only with the \nCounty Limerick. He based his findings on the current (1914) voters' lists \n' wh ich shewed that of the 19,000 persons then registered approximately 14,500 \nhad surnames of native Irish, 2,100 of Norman and 1,700 of English origin (the \nremainder being doubtful or miscellaneous). As I am dealing here with the \ntwo counties of Limerick and Clare, and as the number of vote-rs is now much \ngreater than it was in 1914, I found it impossible in the time at my disposal to \nmake a complete count of the current register for both Clare and Limerick. \nHowever, a count was made for over 50 names in the Co. Clare lists, and I. \nmade considerable use of those for Limerick County and City in other ways as \nwill appear later in this paper. \nAnother authority of a different kind on Irish names is Matheson, who \nwas responsible for producing what is, perhaps, the most interesting \" blue \nbook \"<Z> ever issued by a government in Ireland. Pages 16 to 20 of it may be \ndisregarded, as they are simply a presentation of MacDermott's map in tabular \nform. The chief interest for our present purpose lies in the statistical infor­\nmation compiled from the registrations of births for a selected year (1890). \nUntil I undertook to give the talk on \" Surnames of Thomond,\" which subse­\nquently re~ulted in the writing of this paper, I was inclined to accept the con-· \nclusions which ~atheson based on these official statistics. Taking the number \nof births in the year as indicative of the numerical strength of various names, \nhe found that the following twelve names were the commonest in the country as \na whole : Murphy, Kelly, Sullivan, Walsh, Smith, 0 Brien, Byrne, Ryan, Connor, \nO Neill, Reilly, Doyle. There is no precise way, short of a detailed examina­\ntion of the last census or the voters' lists for the 32 counties to check the accu­\nracy of this list for the present time. A rough and ready test1 however, is to \nbe found in the Telephone Directory for the 26 counties or in Thom's Directory \nof Dublin. Any capital city is, as far· as names are concerned, more or less a \nreflection or microcosm of the whole country. By these tests the position is \nseen to be almost unchanged, the only noticeable difference being that Kennedy \ncomes up into the first dozen and Byrne, as might be expected where Dublin is \nconcerned, rises from seventh to second place. \nIt is somewhat surprising, then, on comparing Woulfe's 1914 figures for \nCo. Limerick with Matheson's to find marked discrepancies in them even whe n \ndue allowance is made for the fact that the latter includes the city and the \nformer does not. The following table shews this : \nRYAN \nOBRIEN \n(0) CONNOR \nWOULFE. \nOrder of \nNo. of Voters. Numerical \nStrength \n644 1 \n375 2 \n364 3 \n2.

          "raw_text": ";::, \nThursday April 13th -Wednesday April 26th• LI I ERICK EV EN TS 6 U IDE MUSIC \nTINDE ·R -HEART .ED \nTINDERSTICKS - Full of the joys of misery \nL\nove and hate, give and take, pains and pleasures, live and die, pasts and present: \nOur _ time in this world could perhaps be documented as a series of polarities -\nemotionally, existentially.Yet even so, surely such extremes could never tell the \nwhole story and often it is only when the distinction between oppo sing sentiments \nbecomes blurred that the truth actually become s clearer and we see ourselves naked, \nand we feel ourselves raw and we know ourselves to be so painfully, painfully real. \nFortunately for us there are a few gifted souls among us who take it upon them selves to \narticulate these same emotions, which sometimes remain too close to the bone to let \neven ourselves in on. One such soul is STUART STAPL ES, vocalist/w riter with English \nmasters of melancholia, TINDERSTICKS , who se insight and lyrical prowes s \nmake the groups' music such a personal experience. Yet again, the writings and voice of \nMr. Staples are just singular pieces of the whole picture whi ch encompa sses the talents, \nthe longings and the determination of six guys who just like to play mu sic. \nTindersticks grew out of the ashes of Nottingham s Asphalt Ribbon s in 1993, with ST A­\nPLES, violinist DICKON HINCHLIFFE and pianist, DA VE BOULTER , picking up \nanother three members during the band 's mutation. Bravely releasing a totally un ique \ndouble album as a debut, they have now just released a second double, intriguingly \ntitled 'Tindersticks Second Album '. After the acclaim lavished upon the first album , it is \nno surprise that for the second, things have stayed pretty much the same , with the deep \nmoody, crushed velvet sounds oft described as cinema-esque, still managing to pierce \nour hearts and heads with the exquisite pain so typical of Tindersticks and so addictive \nto all lovers of great music . \nOn such sound s, the L.£.G . spoke to Tinders ticks m an of the ivories, DAVE \nBOULTER , and asked him, after releasing such a low key un fashionable debut, w ns he \n::,urprised at the critical acclaim it received. \n\"We didn't really build up any expectations as such. At the tim e we just wanted to m nke \nsomethir.ig we were proud of and we knew wh en it wa s finished that if people actually got \nthe chance t0 hear it, that it w ould go d0wn we ll.\" \nAnd well it did go down , with it's blending of guitars, brass and strings, all of w hich are \neven more in evidence on the second album . \n\"Yes, we had a full string section and we kind of sl0wed down the playing to lose their \nlighter side.\" \nWith influences in question and the angst-sweated murmuring s of Staples' lyrics for the \nloverless, bourbon-soaking, 4 o'clock in the m orning listeners, so reminiscent to some 0f \nNick Cave or Leonard Cohen , the disclosure of Portishead and Tricky as m ain players on \nthe Tindersticks personal turntables either seem s totally surprising or perfectly fitting. Yet \nthev alone are not sucked into the Tindersticks style. There also seem s t<'i be n Spanish \ninfl.uence which David insists, \"Is not a conscious thing, though Dickon had spent som e \ntime in Mexico and I think, with that slight influence, it was just the way we choose to tune \nour instruments at the time.\" \nAnd as for the 'country-ish' tones of the record? \n\"Again, it's just a natural thing -especially on the second because we used less electric \nguitar.\" \nElectric guitars were notable in February, when the band played their first gig in six weeks \nin NANCY SPA/NS, CORK. It was a gig enjoyed as much by Tindersticks themselves as by \nthe packed-venue audience. \n\"We hadn't played together in a while and the night itself had a wonderful atmosphere, \nwith people everywhere, and constantly moving about.\" \nPlaying Dublin's Olympia as well as Cork , the band also managed to slip in a few dates in \nLondon and Glasgow, bringing with them a full string section, and David explains, \"Yeah, \nthose shows were just something we really wanted to do and although we'd love to do \nmore of them, they cost more to run than a full tour.'' \nWith no definite plans for further touring in the nearest future, Tindersticks' aficionados \nwill have to be content with the album. Yet, this is no bad thing. On it guests a certain \nCARLA TORGERSON from Seattle's Sub Pop-signed Walk,1bouts and David claims, \n\"We heard a recording of Carias an:J met her in London where, as well as contributing to \n'Travelling Light', we also recorded a couple of backing tracks for her, to be released dur-\ning the Summer.\" \nAnd what about the band's own fortl,nes in the States? \n\"Well, we've been offered supp ort slots with established name s but we decided to \nactually go and play the smaller venues on our ow n merits and things seem to be \ngoing fairly w ell so far.\" • \nOn the new record is a tune which seem s to be taking the piss out of Tinderstick's \nsombr e ima ge. Th e song is a catalogue of disasters befalling 'M y Sister'. \n\"Y es, w ell it is tongue-in-cheek. On the first album too there wa s a humorous side \nwhich people seem ed to miss so I think Stuart decided to m ake it a bit m ore obvious \nthis tim e round .\" And if the lyrics seem m ore story-like second time out, then it's \nbecause, \"For the first record, Stuart had four or five years to put into it whereas the \nsecond was developed over a shorter period of time.\" \nAnd , on a m ore trivial note -the 'tailored' loo k for the sleeve photographs ? \n\"W ell, w e had the chance to get som e new suits m ade up so we too k along a friend to \nthe fittings and she took a few shots w hich seem ed to suit the album .\" \nA nd w hat of a third album - Another double? \n\"W e're thinking of m aking a m ore stripped dow n record w ith m aybe eight songs or \nsom ething.\" \nH ow ever, until then, we 'll have to be content w ith seconds. \nA nd w e are. But pass the bourbon, turn out the lights, for if there is a third album and \nit follow s the lamp- lit, rain-dirtied road of Tindersticks and Th e Tindersticks Second \nA lbum, then we 'll w ait. \nY es, we 'll wait. \nPET E R POP \nThe Dream Wcirrioi;-------=----\nln: D ay Out ' sin le ore b_ock.

An open fireplace upstairs, \nwhich casts it's light across a unique collection of old Irish -----=~'.....:::~~~---_j \ninstruments, does much to create an intimate and cosy \natmosphere, while downstairs the mood is one of jocularity \nwith much chat, ceol and craic. The pub , while dating back \nto the early part of the last century (when it was known as \nthe quaint 'Captain Hog's and before that, 'Arthurs'), is, in \nfact, one of the oldest registered pubs in Limerick City. It's \na history that the new management , Orbit Taverns \nLtd., are eager to preserve. Reopening the pub on 31 \nMarch , Joan Syed of Orb it Taverns and Bar Manager , \nFiona Kiely, have worked hard to maintain the pub's \natmosphere, with help from bar-person, Ronan \nO'Brien, and much support from Joan's husband, \nWasiif. Monday nights sees local songster, Siobhan \nO'Brien, playing a beautiful acoustic blend of folk and \nrock to the packed pub while the near future promises \nmore musical treats when the University of Limer­\nick Trad' Society kick-start their regular spot. Music \nobviously plays a big part of the pub 's already .icclaimed \nreputation, but those who may just prefer a quier pint with \nfriends can still enjoy the surroundings during an afternoon \nll!nchb~~a_k, wit_h delicious homemade soups anc sandwich­\nes on-the menu. Either way , whether it's lively sounds or a \nrelaxing few hours away from the mayhem of day-to-day \ntoil , you wouldn't go wrong with a quick stroll into \nGallaghers. \nCongratulations & Best Wishes \nto \nGallaghers \nDrink With The Best \nCORRI B \nMINERAL WATERS \n~t•:s1a;1a•1~aa \nSomeone asked me last week what I am going to do in a \nfew weeks time when the season ends for the Summer \nbreak. What will a football junkie like my self do during the \nfootball famine that is the greater part of June, July and \nAugu st. The on ly place I can think (_>f that they'll be playing \ngoal-games is inside the Arctic Circle but are you really \ninterested in me singing the praises of underdog s Bodo­\nGI imp Harriers coming f_rom be~ind to beat A._F.~­\nRe yahvic 2-1 in the lceland1c Cup Final replay .... ! d1dn t \nBrought to you by the Man-In­\nThe-Know, Rockin' Hitcher \nHimself, NIALL QUINN ..... \nm ost likely be their only hope of silverware this season \nas Blackburn seem to have a firm if not copperfastened \ngrip on the league title, though Leeds Utd . could do their \nold foe a favour when Btackburn play them on Saturday \nas Leeds are still fighting hard for a UEFA Cup spot. \nThough even if Blackbum lose at Elland Road they may \nbe too far ahead to be caught. 'Till next time. \nthink so. ,. \nNow before the flood ot' letters arrive, suggesting that i \nwrite about tennis, can I just point out that tennis is, in fact, \na shit sport played by Big Girls Blouses and soppy girlies \nwho wear silky scarves like air-hostesses and dnnk half \npints of 'Heino' (probably). The only Wimbledon I'll be \nwriting for is the one Viny Jones plays for. Now piss off!! \nWhat else is on? The Rugby World Cup (Oh Gawd!) .... \nPlenty of GAA (Oh Jaysus, don 't get me started). Anyw~y, \nI'll get on with it: Limerick earned _another couple of wms \nin the last few days -wins that take them closer to a play off \nplace with Finn Harps to decide who goes up to the pre­\nmier division with UCO and Drogheda . \nOn Sunday last they walked all over L~n~ford Town, b:at~ \ning them 3-0 in a thoroughly entertammg game . Da1th1 \nMcMahons goal (limerick's second) was _the pie~ of the \nthree ... Absolutely Brilliant. it was Da1th1 agam who \nscored the onlv goal against Kilkenny City a few days ear­\nlier in what real sports journalists call \"a dour encounter\". \nI spoke with several of theUm:rick players later on m the \nDesmond Arms (who quite kmdly sponsor post-match \nmeals for the teams) and they felt the game was as frustrat­\ning on the pitch as it was on the terrace. Basically, Kilken­\nny fielded eleven goalkeepers who were under stnct \norders not to attempt to play football at any cost. So we \nwere treated to 90 minutes of eleven K ilkenny players \ncrowding their ow n box ,ind goa l-line. I wonder if their \nclub motto is the Latin trnnslation of \"D efend For Yo ur \nLives\". Anyway, Limerick eventually picked up the three \npoints which is what m atters most at this stage. As I was \nsaying, I was chatting with some of the players - dead \nsound blokes they are too, so watch out fur som e of their \npersonal profiles in 'WORD UP ' in the next coup le of \nissues of the L.E.G. Meanwhile, mak e sure that you get to \nHogan Park for Limericks last home gnme ()f the \nseason - that vital gam e with Finn Harp s on Sun-\nday 23 April. \nNorthern Ireland seem to have taken some lessons \nfrom Kilkenny City in the art of annoying the shit \nout of everyone present. Thou gh -credit w here it'~ \ndue -they took their goal excellently. It w.is c1 lst) a \nday when you really need the likes nf John Sheri­\ndan to be on form and he, c1nd others with him , hc1d \na quiet day. A 1-1 draw wc1sn't an absolute disaster \nbut it was a bigger set-back than Jack Charlton was \nadmitting. It has basically given Portugal the initic1-\nhve : We've slipped up and they know thnt if they \ndon't slip they'll top the group . On the up side \nthough; it has set up the game on Wednesday 26 \nApril in Dublin to be n hotly contested one. Ireland \nneed to win to regain pole position but if Portugal \nwin they're home and dry to the finals (barring dis­\nasters) and only half way through the qualifying \nseries. The game should be a cracker .... I reckon \nwe'll win 2-0. \nBy the time you read this Man Utd. will probably \nhave finally overpowered Crystal Palace to ec1rn ·a \nmeeting with Everton in the F.A. Cup Final. That'll \nPage Six \nNEXT HOME GAME: \nBord Gais National League Division One \nLimerick F.C.

      "chunk_text": "wheels \nof steel \nNOW THE DRUGS DON'T WORK ..... :Micheal Lehane \nconcludes his coverage of the 1998 Tour De France and \nponders on what it has in store and how it now has to \novercome the sports biggest obstacle yet ..... . \nThis is a race that has fallen into the abyss it has hovered over \nfor many years. As I write this piece the Festina team riders \nand 4 TVM team officials are in police custody facing drug \ncharges. A belief that over 95% of riders use performance \nenhancing drugs seems at this moment to have a new sense of \nauthenticity. It's the end of the tour as we know it. \nFirstly the way in which the race has effected the Irish public. A \nfew weeks ago a charity cycle around the ring of Kerry was \nfilled with tight fitting cycling jerseys and grown men vied with \none another to win the de facto stage. In Dublin a man arrived \nat a McDonalds Drive Thru wearing cycling gear and obviously \nenough was cycling a bike. The staff refused to serve the cyclist \nin a Drive Thru. Cycling may well have ceased skulking in the \nnational sports psyche, but its influence had not extended far. \nOn a serious note as the race left Ireland the festina drug story \nbegan to intensify. The team's doctor, Rijckaert and the manag­\ner, Rousell were arrested . Days later the riders were expelled \nfrom the race. The rumours that have followed the sport could \nno longer be idly dismissed. Also the secret code of silence \nwhich kept the house in order was crumbling rapidly. \nHowever cycling has come through rough days in the past. In \n1967, Tom Simpson died from over use of amphetamines. Then \nthere was the Pollentier affair of 1978. Delgado found himself \nin trouble in 1988 and the PDM team was surrounded in drug \ncontroversy in 1991 . This might suggest that the sport is once \nagain experiencing mere turbulence. \nYet it seems as if some definite action will spring from the latest \ndrugs story. This is not exclusively because of its high profile; no \na change is currently wafting its way through world sport. This \nchange has been born out of the corporate need for improved \nperformances which in turn has led to excessive amounts of drug \nabuse. Athletics find themselves in the middle of these forces. \nThey are victims in a milieu which demands that barriers are \nconstantly broken. It looks as if men who stuff their bodies with \nthe goods to produce the performances are the only people \ncapable of freeing sport from the claws of Mr. Commerce. \nThis is a process that may have already begun. A French jour­\nnalist last week was given a rare insight into the prevalence of \ndrugs in the peleton, by an experienced rider. For obvious rea­\nsons this material was not printed, but the silence is beginning to \nbreak. A rebellion of sorts from the riders is very near and this \nwill lead to a catharsis in the sport. Unfortunately such cleans­\nings can often turn farcical. Few can forget the scapegoating of \nBen Johnson by the Dubin enquiry after his infamous positive \ndrugs test after the 1988 Olympics. The destruction of Johnson \nmerely avoided the real culprits i.e. the demanding advertising \ncommunity. \nLet us hope that cycling can make a unique step forward and \nfully expose its problems. However the riders will probably suffer \nmost with the other team members also getting a wrap on the \nknuckles. But realistically what alternatives are there for teams \nwho need success? Is it not the responsibility of the team manag­\ner to equip his riders adequately (even if this means having a co­\nordinated policy on drug taking)? The presence of a team doctor \nsurely is safer than riders administering the substances them­\nselves? \nImprovement is a vital part of Sport. The introduction of perfor­\nmance enhancing drugs was very much in keeping with this \ntrade. Room for improvement has reached its end in many sports \nsome time ago. Physical human development cannot extend \nmuch further if the addition of drugs is not permitted. If the \nhuman body is respected and the view that it is some kind of \nengine altered; then sport will have to face the reality that less \nand less records will be broken. \nWhether sport can survive this truth is open to question. The con­\ntinuous rate of newness will cease and so its marketing powers \nmay fall. Both the media mogul and the armchair fan will have \nto accept that we have exceeded the limits . If such an awaken­\ning does not occur then the destruction of the human body will \ncontinue and the soul of the sport will ultimately run out of clean \nair. \nWhatever the long term consequences of this year's Tour will be it \nis still a grand spectacle. The transient greatness of Cipploni will \nendure in the memory with his 2 stage wins bringing a smile to \nhis face before he retired from the race because of fever. The \nsublime strength of the climbers like Panthaini (winner of the pau \nstage) is still wonderful to watch. And who can not be impressed \nby the resilience of last winters fat boy, Jan Ullrich who it seems \nwill win in Paris on August second. It is the hope of all sports \npeople that his victory will represent a new age of honesty in \nworld cycling; but...e:rhaps this is mere idealism in an already \ndestroyed sport. ~ \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the Tour de France",

          "text": "Sinead Lohan has been in the music \nbusiness from the day she left school \nand will probably tell you that she \nwas in it from the time she was \nborn. Her new single \"Whatever it \nTakes is currently making an impact \nin the Irish charts. This is the first \nsingle from her forthcoming second \nalbum \"No Mermaid\" this second \nalbum will be a more experienced \nand telling instalment of Lohan's \nmusic. DROP looks into the Cork \nborn singer song writer ..... \nWhen Sinead Lohan left school she enrolled \nimmediately into a music course the only \nproblem being it was a music business \ncourse and so didn't have as much of an \nemphasis on actual music itself. Still it was \ngetting Ms . Lohan on the path to a life in \nmusic. It wasn't until the last few days of the \ncourse that the students had to perform a \ncomposition. Sinead performed her own \ncomposition and decided to use the perfor­\nmance as a test of her music ability deciding \nthat if the song didn't go down well she \nwould pretend it wasn't her composition at \nall!! Needless to say the song was great and \nher experience there inspired her to go on \nto sing in the small and intimate environs of \n\"The Lobby\" in Cork. It was here that for­\nmer Moving Hearts and Horslips man, \nDeclan Sinnott came across the rising talent. \nSinnott was working with Mary Black at the \ntime. Sinott loved the music and set about \nrecording the Lohan's debut album while in­\nbetween projects. This recording process \nlasted two and half years. \nis this that she attributes her song writing \nskills, saying that its her \"imagination that \ngives the music its emotional range and \ndream like ambience\". Her music is a pic­\nture of her feelings and she herself explains \n\"I take a photograph of feelings and \ninstants ... ! want to express the things that \nare very internal. There are no 'messages'. \njust get involved in an emotion that I know \nwhen I sing the song on stage, the sentiment \nreturns - because the sentiment is sincere, \nit's real\". That the emotion is real and sin­\ncere is definitely apparent when listening to \nher music. \nHer music has been described by many crit­\nics as having hypnotic qualities to it and \nLohan claims herself that a lot of people find \nthemselves listening to the music rather than \nthe lyrics even though the lyrics are very \nclear \" I try to make melodies that are hyp­\nnotic, that go round and round until you \ndon't know what I'm saying or what it \nmeans, but there's a feeling way down in the \nmusic. That's why I always been inspired by \nsounds like the hum of a washing machine \nor the rhythm of a moving train\". The hyp­\nnotic element to her songs is something that \nSinead Lohan has been espousing for some \ntime now and claimed in another interview \nthat when she was at the young age of thir­\nteen and in the early days of compos ing \nmusic she would write all the time \"produc­\ning poems , prose whatever came into my \nhead. Then because I liked music I put the \ntwo together and started melodies to songs \nin my head which I'd get from rhythmic \nthings like washing machines or trains.\" \nObviously enough Mrs. Lohan took young \nSinead on many an outing to the laundrette -\nwhich must have been a train ride away \nSinead Lohan \nSinead was included in \"A Woman 's Heart 2 \nCollection\". The success of this increase her \nreputation as a serious performer within the \nmusic world. In 1993 Lohan's debut album \ncame out in Ireland under Dara records and \nin the UK under Grapevine records two \nyears later. The album was called \"Who do \nyou think I am\" and the Sinott production \ngave it an extra seal of approval. It wasn't \nreally until the second release in 1995 that \nthe album started selling. 40,000 copies of \nthe album were sold and two songs on it got \nto the top ten in the singles chart. \nAfter much touring and time spent by Lohan \nbuilding up her profile, it was in May of last \nyear that Sinead began planning a second \nalbum. The second album was recorded in \nNew Orleans with Malcolm Burn who has \nworked with the likes of Peter Gabriel and \nDaniel Lanois. The second album will bring \nLohan in a new direction. \nThe dread locked beaded hair of Ms . Sinead \nLohan is a thick disguise of a former self \nconfessed Micheal Jackson fan. lnfact when \nshe first started composing she was under \nthe influence of the likes of Jackson, Sting, \nPaul Weller and host of Top of the Pops per­\nformers. This was probably because she \nwas thirteen years old at the time. This is \nsomething to be careful of when reading a \nSinead Lohan interview - she tends to men­\ntion things that are necessarily irrelevant on \nfirst glance - in a recent interview it was \nsuggested that the Lohan brain operates on \na number of levels and rarely to these levels \never meet and so for all intents and purpos­\nes could be a described as a classic space \ncadet! \nAll the above accusations have probably \nfound their roots from the fact that Lohan \nhas such a creative and fluid imagination. It \nnp18 \nbecause it has definitely influenced her!!! \nSinead's second album which is due out on \nthe I 0th of this month will show just how \nmuch she has developed as a singer in the \nyears between the first album and this one. \nOne point she herself makes is that the first \nalbum was written over two and a half \nyears and contained a lot of songs that were \nfirst written years before. As a result the \nfeelings weren't current when the songs \nwere eventually released. The second album \nwas written and produced over a somewhat \nshorter time and so should be testament to \na new and more experienced Sinead Lohan. \nThe first release \"Whatever it takes ... \" is \nalready high in the charts and is proving to \nbe much liked by the Irish public hopefully \nthis will also be true of the rest of the \nalbum.",

          "text": "l \n1 \nCarter \nThe Carter Twins are, according to the \npublicity material, Ireland's answer to \nBros and Oasis - two brothers performing \ntogether. Recently they were in Limerick \nto promote their latest single. One of \ntheir biggest cynics, Duncan O'Toole went \nalong to meet them ..... \nWhen I was informed that the Carter Twins were \nin town and available for interview I laughed a loud \nand made various slaggs about how DROP was \nabove them but I started thinking ... who am I to \ndecide when I've never even met these guys and \nhaven't heard their music even. Anyway in the spir­\nit of co-operation and understanding as encouraged \nduring recent trouble up North I decided what the \nhell lets meet these guys ..... . \nI hastily made a list of questions designed to trick \nthem out expecting that all answers would be \nrehearsed and rhymed off to me like a bad cover of \na Stock Aiken and Waterman song. This was not \nthe case. First off the Carter twins actually do have \nlives and the whole affair was a relaxed one, so \nmuch so that the interview ended in the middle of \nO 'Connell street at 2.30am somewhere between \nThe Globe Bar and O'Connell Ave. They headed \nto their lodgings for the night and I hit auto drive \nand let my body carry me home. \nSteven and Tony Carter are Louis Walsh's next big \nthing - the two lads have been under his wing for \ntwo years now and their success to date has been \nrocky to say the least. They first came to promi­\nnence in 1996 when they were adopted by that \nwicked social cult \"Smash Hits\" and proclaimed the \n\"Most promising and exploitative band\" or some­\nthing like that. It was the same year that Boyzone \nhad taken the mantle from Take That and things \nwere looking good for Louis Walsh and his band of \nmerry ehm .. bands. However since then the Boys \nhave made a relatively weak impact on the charts. \nThey released their debut album \"Number one\" \nwhich couldn't have been a more unsuitable title \nbut did contain one or two cover songs that had \nthe public humming away. \nMore recently the duo were in the news or more \nto the point, Louis Walsh was in the news creating \na bit ofa stir because the lads didn't win the \nNational Song Contest when they got to the finals \n• the lads themselves comment that \"of course it \nwas disappointing not to win but the winner was \ngood\" showing no sign of the bitterness reportedly \ncoming from the Louis Walsh camp. Mr. Walsh's \nstable is guilty of past Eurovision successes includ­\ning Johnny Logan, the Eurovision Diva to use the \nspeak. \nAfter all that the boys are now on the publicity \ntrail to promote their latest single; \"Let's Go \ndrop17 \nTwins \nDancing (Oh la,la,la)\" which is receiving major air­\nplay and was just released this week. At the time \nof writing its rumoured to enter very high in the \ncharts. The song itself sounds like it's got the right \ningredients for success it even has the \"oh la, la, la\" \nbit in it -which is essential for chart topping suc­\ncess!!!. \nThe Carters themselves are very confident about \nthe single and the reaction so far has been great as \nreflected in the amount of airplay it is receiving. \nThe two lads hail from Coolock on the North side \nof Dublin city. They first discovered their singing \nability when one of them won a Karaoke competi­\ntion in a bar. The two were straight away encour­\naged to sing together following the obvious rule \nthat if one can sing then so can the other. \nIronically it was while doing a spoof Eurovision in \nthe POD in Dublin that Louis Walsh came across \nthem and got them signed to BMG . \nThey have no history of musicians in the family and \nthe lads claim that they are starting it themselves . \nWhen prompted on whether or not they can play \nan instrument they say quite openly that they can't \nplay an instrument but Tony prompts \"I was in the \nSchool choir\" to which Stephen butts in \"he means \nqueer not choir!\" - the joking is a trademark of \nthe lads and as the interview goes on, you begin to \nsee why they are doing what they are doing • \nbecause they enjoy a good laugh. I mean they have \nbeen spending the week travelling Ireland in a car \nwith a driver/ minder/organiser from BMG going to \nall the different Radio Stations in the country to \npromote the new single. After that they begin a \nseries of promotional stints around the country's \nHMV outlets as well as the \"Beat on the Street\"s • \na lot of hard work but the lads seem to be able to \nsurvive by enjoying themselves. \nAs to where they see themselves after the \"Carter \nTwins\" experience runs its course, they want to \nstay in the entertainment business and perhaps \nchange their style in music. Robbie Williams is a \nmate of theirs and went on the town with the lads \nwhen he was in Dublin at Christmas. They have \ngreat respect for him both from the way he has \nchanged his career and also because \"he's mad \ncrack! We had to help him learn the words for a \nBoyzone song a few minutes before he went on \nstage to sing it with the lads\". On Boyzone, the \nCarters have even more admiration and have co­\nwritten a song with Ronan Keating. His brother \nmanages the bands affairs and as Mr. Keating hails \nfrom Swords which isn't too far from the lads base \nin Coolock they tend to end up on the sauce a lot \ntogether. Which is something I ended up doing \nwith the twins. They can sing as witnessed in New \n95FM studios they don't look awful, they're a good \nlaugh - they'll go a long way!!! \nFor anyone interested in seeing them play live just \ngrap a little sister or just happen to be going by \nHMV on Cruises Street at around 5pm on August \n6th.@)",

          "text": "SOCCER ROCKER \nI was down around the Rathbone area the other week and, \nas it's in the vicinity, I decided to pop into Hogan Park just to \nsee how the developments are coming along. The first thing \nthat grabbed my eye was the amount of fancy agricultural \nequipment zooming around the playing field like dodgems at \nfunderland. They're apparently ripping up strips of turf, \ninjecting sand and sticking the grass back down which will \nhopefully enhance the pitches capacity to drain itself and \nsimultaneously ruin my capacity to crack crap jokes about \nman-eating sharks in the puddle outside the shed end goal­\nmouth. Next thing I noticed (or rather didn't notice as I man ­\naged to trip over one) was the concrete pedestals which have \nbeen put in place to anchor our brand new (cue \nfanfare ..... da daaa!!!!)FLOODLIGHTS!!!!. Now, while the \npylons themselves were not in place yet I'm told that they will \nbe up and running in time for the start of the season. If \nyou're wondering what way they're going to be aligned it \nappears that there'll be four or five of them along the lengths \nof the pitch as opposed to the \"one on each corner\" align­\nment that you see out in Thomond park rugby ground. Also, \njust in case you're a concerned resident of the area adjacent \nto Hogan Park, Fear not-Limericks lights shall not turn your \nnight-time panorama into something resembling a scene from \nthe movie 'Independence Day' as Thomond Parks' do to \nmuch of Clareview, Mayorstone, Ballynanty Beg, Killeely and \nCaherdavin. Though anybody who thinks you don't need the \nfloodlights in a football ground to go up as high as they do \nfor rugby has yet to encounter the unique footballing experi­\nence that is Longford Town F.C. \nWith all this work going on at Limericks home ground an \nalternative venue had to be found to host Limericks first dash, \nfor many years, with cross-channel opposition and, despite \nAertel, Ceefax and the national media conspiring to convince \ndrap18 \nLimericks football-going public that the game was on in U.L., \nall 150 or so of us found out that Limerick F.C. would be \nplaying Shropshires finest Shrewsbury Town at Jackman Park. \nThe game itself was bloody awful with neither side being \nhelped by weather that varied from blindingly glorious early \nevening sunshine to torrential downpours that made the play­\ning surface slippy. I suspect Limericks attempts at cohesion \nweren't helped by the number of unfamiliar faces in their \nranks either. In fact I recognised nearly as many Shrewsbury \nTown players.(Yes I confess ... I do watch 'The Nationwide \nLeague' after 'Prisoner Cell Block H' on a Monday night.) \nWhat was quite unsettling watching Limerick though was that, \ndespite their new jerseys being very smart, shiny and profes­\nsional looking with their big new sponsors logo emblazoned \n(DELL), Limericks traditional blue shirts now sport ( ... spits!!!) \nred collars and red cuffs!. Even my old Limerick shirt from \n'93/'94 which was just blue with a couple of white bits on \nthe sleeves used to evoke inquiries as to how long I'd been a \nGlasgow Rangers fan. I can only hazard a couple of guesses \nas to why this foul colour has been allowed besmirch our \ntreasured shirts ... \na) Whoever O.K'd the Dell sponsorship deal is a Rangers fan \nor an Oldham Athletic fan and insisted upon the colour \nchange. \nb) Red was introduced so that the 700 red seats we got from \nBolton Wanderers would fit in better. \nAnyway, I guess we'll never know. By next time the new sea­\nson will be almost upon us. 'Til then. @",

          "text": "WORLD CHAMPION 1998?WHAT ARE \nTHE ODDS ON HOSS CARNEY HAVING \nTHE ANSWER? \nWe're just over half way through the season, half way \naround another year of whaling VI O's, exploding brake discs and \nchampagne soaked podiums, half way to gearing up for another \nWinter of discontent - with only the prospect of 1999 to keep us \namused - and half way to finding out which of our twenty two dri­\nvers will walk off with the title of World Champion. Way back in \nearly March - prior to the first race in Melbourne -the Bookies \nwere quoting Schumacher as odds on \nfavourite (9/4), Villeneuve next up \n( I I /4) and Hakkinen and Coulthard a \ncompetitive, if rather uncuddly, joint \nthird on (4/ I). Now if I'd been blessed \nwith a crystal ball, some fresh tens and \na lift down to my local turf accoun­\ntants, then at this point in the champi­\nonship, just after Silverstone, the twen­\nty I should have surely placed on \nHakkinen would have been making me . \nfeel rather smug just now. Instead I put \nthe money on Canada's ex-lndycar \nchamp and current title holder \nVilleneuve. Money down the drain, spilt 1' \nmilk, my loss and someone else's gain. 'J \nFor those of you who were wise \n1 \nenough to either gamble upon the \nMclaren duo, or to meekly put your life \nsavings down on the German \nWunderkind, things - as the prostitute \nmight have whispered to her wealthy \nclient -are looking up.All you need to \ndo now is sit back, see which of these \nguys is going to monster the remaining seven races and hopefully \npick up your winnings come November -for its unlikely anyone \noutside these three will challenge for this year's Driver's title. \nPedro Diniz might sound attractive at 550 to I, but really, what \nwould be the point. He and the rest might as well be a billion to \none for all it matters. \nSo with the British GP leaving Hakkinen on 56pts, \nSchumacher with a neat 54pts and the excessively jawed Scot \n30pts, its set the scene for an intriguing final bunch of races. You \nmight imagine that having a mere 30pts would rule Coulthard out \nof the equation, or possibly even allow us to include the resurgent \nIrvine (one place behind on 29pts), but the facts are Irvine would \nprobably be shot if he attempted to steal the crown from \nSchumacher, and Coulthard's deficit has more to do with bad luck \nthan bad driving. Broken engines, poor pit stops and dodgy team \ntactics have worked against him, and in favour of the others, but \nI'd be surprised if he didn't turn it all around and put in a better \nend to '98 than at least Hakkinen, and maybe even Schumacher. \nWhether that would be enough to dislodge his opponents and \nclinch the number one spot I don't know, but on a level playing \nfield I'd have my money on Coulthard (that said, I was the same \nidiot who was convinced a certain Canadian ex lndycar champ \nwas a dead cert, wasn't I). Then again if fate continues to cast a \nwicked spell upon his weekends all he can hope for is the reten­\ntion of third. Not much consolation when he's equipped with \narguably the best car on the grid, but better than having Eddie \ncome up from behind, snatch that third place, and really rub his \nnose in it. \nOf the others, Hakkinen and Shuey, only two points sepa­\nrate them (as we went to press) and with seven races, fourteen \nhours and 182 points remaining its hard to do anything other \nthan speculate upon a potential outcome. Here's how I see it. \nBarring mechanical failure, the one factor that will influence the \noutcome of this year's campaign more than any other is the \nweather.A majority of wet races and Michael will surely win. His \nprowess in the rain is legendary. Silverstone was wet, and he \nwon. He did the same at all three wet races in 1997 - Monte \nCarlo, Magny Cours and Spa Franorchamps.And so on ..... \nConsidering that this year's Ferrari is not a million miles off the \nMclaren's pace, not any more at least, then a splattering of the \nwet stuff should allow Schumacher to shade it. On the other \nhand, dial in dry and sunny conditions and I'd imagine the dynam­\nically superior MP4- I 3 will give Hakkinen the edge. \nNow at the moment I happen not to be in the lap of the \nGods, so I couldn't even forecast for tomorrow, let alone for the \nnext four months, so any predictions I make will be purely guess \nwork. What I can offer is an outcome which is my own personal \nfavourite (you might imagine it involving over half-a-dozen Jordan \nvictories, but even my best intentions must remain somewhat \nwithin the realms of hard nosed reality). While it would be fitting \nfor the World's greatest driver to win the title of Driver's World \nChampion, it would also see Schumacher etching his name onto \nthe trophy for the third time. As I said, fitting, but nothing origi­\nnal or exciting about it is there. No, what we want is a new \nname, and seeing as they are both uncrowned, either of the \nMclaren lads will do. Let's just hope the rain stays away. @) \nnp18",

          "text": "wheels \nof steel \nNOW THE DRUGS DON'T WORK ..... :Micheal Lehane \nconcludes his coverage of the 1998 Tour De France and \nponders on what it has in store and how it now has to \novercome the sports biggest obstacle yet ..... . \nThis is a race that has fallen into the abyss it has hovered over \nfor many years. As I write this piece the Festina team riders \nand 4 TVM team officials are in police custody facing drug \ncharges. A belief that over 95% of riders use performance \nenhancing drugs seems at this moment to have a new sense of \nauthenticity. It's the end of the tour as we know it. \nFirstly the way in which the race has effected the Irish public. A \nfew weeks ago a charity cycle around the ring of Kerry was \nfilled with tight fitting cycling jerseys and grown men vied with \none another to win the de facto stage. In Dublin a man arrived \nat a McDonalds Drive Thru wearing cycling gear and obviously \nenough was cycling a bike. The staff refused to serve the cyclist \nin a Drive Thru. Cycling may well have ceased skulking in the \nnational sports psyche, but its influence had not extended far. \nOn a serious note as the race left Ireland the festina drug story \nbegan to intensify. The team's doctor, Rijckaert and the manag­\ner, Rousell were arrested . Days later the riders were expelled \nfrom the race. The rumours that have followed the sport could \nno longer be idly dismissed. Also the secret code of silence \nwhich kept the house in order was crumbling rapidly. \nHowever cycling has come through rough days in the past. In \n1967, Tom Simpson died from over use of amphetamines. Then \nthere was the Pollentier affair of 1978. Delgado found himself \nin trouble in 1988 and the PDM team was surrounded in drug \ncontroversy in 1991 . This might suggest that the sport is once \nagain experiencing mere turbulence. \nYet it seems as if some definite action will spring from the latest \ndrugs story. This is not exclusively because of its high profile; no \na change is currently wafting its way through world sport. This \nchange has been born out of the corporate need for improved \nperformances which in turn has led to excessive amounts of drug \nabuse. Athletics find themselves in the middle of these forces. \nThey are victims in a milieu which demands that barriers are \nconstantly broken. It looks as if men who stuff their bodies with \nthe goods to produce the performances are the only people \ncapable of freeing sport from the claws of Mr. Commerce. \nThis is a process that may have already begun. A French jour­\nnalist last week was given a rare insight into the prevalence of \ndrugs in the peleton, by an experienced rider. For obvious rea­\nsons this material was not printed, but the silence is beginning to \nbreak. A rebellion of sorts from the riders is very near and this \nwill lead to a catharsis in the sport. Unfortunately such cleans­\nings can often turn farcical. Few can forget the scapegoating of \nBen Johnson by the Dubin enquiry after his infamous positive \ndrugs test after the 1988 Olympics. The destruction of Johnson \nmerely avoided the real culprits i.e. the demanding advertising \ncommunity. \nLet us hope that cycling can make a unique step forward and \nfully expose its problems. However the riders will probably suffer \nmost with the other team members also getting a wrap on the \nknuckles. But realistically what alternatives are there for teams \nwho need success? Is it not the responsibility of the team manag­\ner to equip his riders adequately (even if this means having a co­\nordinated policy on drug taking)? The presence of a team doctor \nsurely is safer than riders administering the substances them­\nselves? \nImprovement is a vital part of Sport. The introduction of perfor­\nmance enhancing drugs was very much in keeping with this \ntrade. Room for improvement has reached its end in many sports \nsome time ago. Physical human development cannot extend \nmuch further if the addition of drugs is not permitted. If the \nhuman body is respected and the view that it is some kind of \nengine altered; then sport will have to face the reality that less \nand less records will be broken. \nWhether sport can survive this truth is open to question. The con­\ntinuous rate of newness will cease and so its marketing powers \nmay fall. Both the media mogul and the armchair fan will have \nto accept that we have exceeded the limits . If such an awaken­\ning does not occur then the destruction of the human body will \ncontinue and the soul of the sport will ultimately run out of clean \nair. \nWhatever the long term consequences of this year's Tour will be it \nis still a grand spectacle. The transient greatness of Cipploni will \nendure in the memory with his 2 stage wins bringing a smile to \nhis face before he retired from the race because of fever. The \nsublime strength of the climbers like Panthaini (winner of the pau \nstage) is still wonderful to watch. And who can not be impressed \nby the resilience of last winters fat boy, Jan Ullrich who it seems \nwill win in Paris on August second. It is the hope of all sports \npeople that his victory will represent a new age of honesty in \nworld cycling; but...e:rhaps this is mere idealism in an already \ndestroyed sport. ~ \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the Tour de France",

Respecting these complexities it would however be foir \nta note the jazzy ambience of their music. \nMoonboot are currently recording a demo of their new material using the \nfacilities at U.L. Eddie feels their sound runs the risk of being misinterpreted \nyet he hopes the advantage of this demo will be to increase an awareness of \nthe bonds definitive music. \nJudging by this bonds worthiness it would appear that their intentions are to \nmake it in the music industry but Dave explains the overwhelming complica· \nlions and political factors involved. ''You know the Limerick scene maybe \ndynamite but half these guys ain't gonna get signed\". Ray admits to this \npolitical factor but also adds that it can be extremely disheartening for a \ngroup considering failed objectives and other such struggles in a climate of \nfalse hopes. \nMoonboot are an opinionated bond yet they prefer to suggest and make \nstatements through music as opposed to any other means . Their songs such \nas Forever Now and Spaghetti Western are their own viewpoints and rep­\nresentations, so they are eager for people to hear them. These guys are not \nscared of fame, in fact they are well associated far instance Ray once met \nSean Kelly while Eddie boasts of an encounter with soap opera Demi God \nMiley from Glenroe! ! \nMoonboot's dedication to their music is something that has definitely poid off \n, and testimony to tliis is their calculated yet atmospheric live performances. \nThe bond have a series of important live gigs lined up far August , these \ninclude a support slot for Dublin bond Revelino at the Warehouse (Sat 1 \nAugust) and also a few Dublin gigs at Bruxelles(3 August) and Eamonn \nDorans respectively. These gigs if one can attend are a must for the punter, \nbut if you want ta catch them locally check out the Warehouse or a planned \nCostelloes gig on their return from Dublin. \nC DEMO DESK \nMIKE DUFFY reviews up and coming bands and their releases ..... \nA DERRY GOOD IDEA \n) \nSOME NERVE - Fine Tuning \nHaving a record deal is no longer a pre-requisite to getting exposure \nin the music world. Taking the initiative and putting a Few heads together \ncan be just as fruitful, and that's what's happening Foyleside, where the pro· \ngressive Nerve Centre have released their second collection of Derry's top \nbands together on one CD. \nSet up in 1990 to provide a link between the young people of Derry \nand the technological advances so readily available nowadays, The Nerve \nCentre organised this impressive collection with the main backing of Irish \nFunds ( an organisation which supports projects that advance the causes of \npeace, culture and charity across the country). \nFour local bands get to strut their stuff on \"Fine Tuning\", representing \nthe musically diversity of 'the town we all love so well'. \nThe Food provide the opening track, three young scamps from Derry \nwho provide a different sound not easy to categorise. The track 'Little Man' \nprocesses cool harmonies and a catchy hook that gives a skaish sort of \nsound, with low-Ii beats interspersed throughout. \nDj·vu, who later does his own version of 'Little Man', delivers the sec­\nond track, an excellent dance oriented sound. Its slow drum's 'bass beat is \nsomething akin to Sneaker Pimps material, bumping along with a rap chorus \nthat Chuck D would be proud of. \nArchitects of Sound come from a different angle of the dance genre, a \nmore familiar experimental sound that Orbital or The Future Sound of London \nwould be proud off. 'The 11 th Commandment\" is a collage of hard beats and \nprogrommed sounds which would be bound to go down a storm on the dub \nAoors. \nContaining the diversity, The New Capris are the final act on the col· \nlection. 'Revolution' fuses pop, funk and jazz together resulting in a sound sit­\nuated somewhere between RHCP and the James Taylor Quartet. A little out of \nsine in places, Mairead McClogan magnificent voice could have been utilised \na little better, but the !rock is perhaps the most radio-friendly of 'Fine Tuning'. \nActs collaborating to do remixes of their own material is a popular \nundertaking these days, and the final track here is a remix of the opening \none. dj·vu remix The Food's 'Little Man', offering a totally different slant on \nthe original, even The Food themselves would do well to recognise. \nRecognising the need to give Derry's finest some exposure, The Nerve \nCentre have put together a very professional package. The production and \npackaging are first class, and the whole venture is one which other people \naround the country would do well to emulate. \n,, ... • ~ , :-:-,'· .~❖ ~. ~ ., /·,.J \n• f'···, _. · ... ~ u_-ncl ~tt1tid<11~~rth~,(~-i \n, . credit tbeif.'artisti!=' ·s,ensil;,iliiy wi~• \n•. c;i11_d°.i!1s'i;acl.~ -:~-1o·:iril6~l \n\\&Jstn:tte buuhen Jnh:igU$··~ ,Ii •• \n• with-~biupt:c:luxd ~an~s:t~rki \n:back\"to' their'99rly ¾ :aJ Q''liol \n'Fem~ ~ bciihd); .o~score:. \n. and:'·. . ·· ·.: ·' ,•.

          "text": "This week Gillian Chawke, DROP's eye on fashion, takes a \nlook at The Miss Limerick Beauty Contest of 1998 and \nphilosophises on the merits of beauty pageants in general... ... \nBeauty contests, beouty pageants and fashion shows etc. hove all been criti­\ncised over the years, primarily by the fairer of the sex, as being demeaning \nto women, segregating the good from the bod (and the ugly?) and associat­\ning a certain \"Barbie Inspired Mon-made Bubbly Over-rated\" type beauty \nwith the girl in question. Others hove argued that it is what people want \n(mole and female) and that it is just another form of modelling. Either way \nis it the kind of entertainment the 90's women wish to be a port of? \nApparently so judging by the volume of applicants and consequently suc­\ncessful entrants into this year's Miss Limerick Beauty Pageant at the Castle \nLone Tavern, Limerick. Over 35 girls paraded the catwalk in a selection of \nday wear (of the girls choice) and evening wear while 2FM's Lorean Murray \ninquisitioned those \"lucky\" enough to be called bock with ambiguous ques­\ntions and statements which hod the girls giggling incessantly or simply stum­\nbling and stuttering over their well prepared words. Believe me this is a \npersonal recollection, it is a nerve-rocking experience that only the strong \nsurvive. It was emphasised however that all of the judges had spoken at \nlength with each of the entrants and were dose to making a decision before \nthe show hod even begun! Was the finale simply for the public's enjoy­\nment? Well if so they succeeded. \nThe night began on the riverside setting with a beautifully presented buffet \nto tempt palettes and a few \"coups\" of bucks fizz to wash it down . The \nCastle Lane Tavern, Limerick's newest/oldest public house added a wonder­\nful historical magic ambience to the event and was a cosy host to the event. \nIf the interest is anything similar \nto what they achieved this year \nthen next year's organisers \nshould begin securing a larger \nvenue now. \nThere was one entrant however \nwhose intelligent and witty \nremarks stood out amongst the \ncrowd and even had the incorri­\ngible Mr. Murray stuck for \nwords at one point. It was \nNicole Smith, who along with \nher stunning looks complement­\ned by a duck-egg blue/ green \nknit creation by local designer \nMargaret Ryan, was selected \nMiss Limerick 1998 and was repre­\nsenting The Globle /Nestors Bars \nand Restaurants. She will go on to \nrepresent Limerick at the Miss \nIreland competition held in the \nBurlington Hotel, Dublin in late \nAugust and we wish her all the \nluck in the world. \nSo do you hove what it tokes to \nenter a competition based on per­\nsonal appearance and public per­\nception? Do you hove the courage \nto stand up on a stage in front of \nyour piers and sell yourself for who \nyou ore? The real question is do you want or need to in order to convince \nyourself? Does it matter to you what other people perceive you to be? \nAre you comfortable enough with yourself and the way you look, to not \ncore? Well if you ore then no beauty contest in the world will make you \nfeel more beautiful then the radiance that is emitted from someone who is \nhappy and content with their life and themselves.

      "raw_text": "wheels \nof steel \nNOW THE DRUGS DON'T WORK ..... :Micheal Lehane \nconcludes his coverage of the 1998 Tour De France and \nponders on what it has in store and how it now has to \novercome the sports biggest obstacle yet ..... . \nThis is a race that has fallen into the abyss it has hovered over \nfor many years. As I write this piece the Festina team riders \nand 4 TVM team officials are in police custody facing drug \ncharges. A belief that over 95% of riders use performance \nenhancing drugs seems at this moment to have a new sense of \nauthenticity. It's the end of the tour as we know it. \nFirstly the way in which the race has effected the Irish public. A \nfew weeks ago a charity cycle around the ring of Kerry was \nfilled with tight fitting cycling jerseys and grown men vied with \none another to win the de facto stage. In Dublin a man arrived \nat a McDonalds Drive Thru wearing cycling gear and obviously \nenough was cycling a bike. The staff refused to serve the cyclist \nin a Drive Thru. Cycling may well have ceased skulking in the \nnational sports psyche, but its influence had not extended far. \nOn a serious note as the race left Ireland the festina drug story \nbegan to intensify. The team's doctor, Rijckaert and the manag­\ner, Rousell were arrested . Days later the riders were expelled \nfrom the race. The rumours that have followed the sport could \nno longer be idly dismissed. Also the secret code of silence \nwhich kept the house in order was crumbling rapidly. \nHowever cycling has come through rough days in the past. In \n1967, Tom Simpson died from over use of amphetamines. Then \nthere was the Pollentier affair of 1978. Delgado found himself \nin trouble in 1988 and the PDM team was surrounded in drug \ncontroversy in 1991 . This might suggest that the sport is once \nagain experiencing mere turbulence. \nYet it seems as if some definite action will spring from the latest \ndrugs story. This is not exclusively because of its high profile; no \na change is currently wafting its way through world sport. This \nchange has been born out of the corporate need for improved \nperformances which in turn has led to excessive amounts of drug \nabuse. Athletics find themselves in the middle of these forces. \nThey are victims in a milieu which demands that barriers are \nconstantly broken. It looks as if men who stuff their bodies with \nthe goods to produce the performances are the only people \ncapable of freeing sport from the claws of Mr. Commerce. \nThis is a process that may have already begun. A French jour­\nnalist last week was given a rare insight into the prevalence of \ndrugs in the peleton, by an experienced rider. For obvious rea­\nsons this material was not printed, but the silence is beginning to \nbreak. A rebellion of sorts from the riders is very near and this \nwill lead to a catharsis in the sport. Unfortunately such cleans­\nings can often turn farcical. Few can forget the scapegoating of \nBen Johnson by the Dubin enquiry after his infamous positive \ndrugs test after the 1988 Olympics. The destruction of Johnson \nmerely avoided the real culprits i.e. the demanding advertising \ncommunity. \nLet us hope that cycling can make a unique step forward and \nfully expose its problems. However the riders will probably suffer \nmost with the other team members also getting a wrap on the \nknuckles. But realistically what alternatives are there for teams \nwho need success? Is it not the responsibility of the team manag­\ner to equip his riders adequately (even if this means having a co­\nordinated policy on drug taking)? The presence of a team doctor \nsurely is safer than riders administering the substances them­\nselves? \nImprovement is a vital part of Sport. The introduction of perfor­\nmance enhancing drugs was very much in keeping with this \ntrade. Room for improvement has reached its end in many sports \nsome time ago. Physical human development cannot extend \nmuch further if the addition of drugs is not permitted. If the \nhuman body is respected and the view that it is some kind of \nengine altered; then sport will have to face the reality that less \nand less records will be broken. \nWhether sport can survive this truth is open to question. The con­\ntinuous rate of newness will cease and so its marketing powers \nmay fall. Both the media mogul and the armchair fan will have \nto accept that we have exceeded the limits . If such an awaken­\ning does not occur then the destruction of the human body will \ncontinue and the soul of the sport will ultimately run out of clean \nair. \nWhatever the long term consequences of this year's Tour will be it \nis still a grand spectacle. The transient greatness of Cipploni will \nendure in the memory with his 2 stage wins bringing a smile to \nhis face before he retired from the race because of fever. The \nsublime strength of the climbers like Panthaini (winner of the pau \nstage) is still wonderful to watch. And who can not be impressed \nby the resilience of last winters fat boy, Jan Ullrich who it seems \nwill win in Paris on August second. It is the hope of all sports \npeople that his victory will represent a new age of honesty in \nworld cycling; but...e:rhaps this is mere idealism in an already \ndestroyed sport. ~ \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the Tour de France",

      "chunk_text": "J. \n( Limrock Profiles........ ) \nThis week Ronan Hennessy talks to local band PATROL. .... \nBaggy , \"Madchester'' and all those memorable sounds of the \nearly 90' s dance/rock crossover ... are Patrol its lineal succes­\nsors? Well these are the sort of things that matter to Patrol's \nfrontmen Johnny \nand Ronan C. \nSince their for­\nmation one year \nago this relatively \nunknown band \nhave immerged \nwith the intention \nof spear-heading \nthis so called \n\"Baggy\" renais­\nsance. They \nhave reason to \nbe anxious after \nall they are bear­\ning the reputation \nof this once leg­\nendary music \nsound while attempting to breathe valuable life into it. \nRonan is mad for it and the strength of his bands music together \nwith his own convictions are testimony of this. Patrol could easily \nshake off the Stone Roses tag but will others notice this vital \ndetachment? Of course with songs like \"Super Vague Dowie\" \nand \"Rapid Belly\" one should recognize this all important individ­\nuality. The band however are more certain about their mus ic. \nRonan hopes they'll be bigger than Asian \"Cos they are a great \nIrish band d'you whatha I mean\". \nPatrol are determined to put a more objective feel to the some­\ntimes muted expression wh ich is music. \"When I read Carl Jung \nor Nietzsche things just fall into place but still I'm still a lad d'you \nknow, I believe in intuition cos I'm not goin' subscribing to the \nbackwater of contrived masculinity I don't pretend and I don't \nread Loaded magazine\". \nTaking a band who seem so much in the know their knowledge \nof Limrock is suprisingly scant. Ronan says \"Yeah we are local \nband but maybe not in touch, I mean people go on about \nFigment but I never heard of them\". \nJohnny sees the band as hard working and generally steady with \na full year of practice and demo behind their backs but is only \nready to declare that unlike the \"Celtic tiger'' they are not exclu­\nsive . \"We truly love everyone\". \nPatrol will play alongside Box , Amber and Mosaic in a July 19 \nfixture at Costellos . \nCatch them waxing lyrical there or check out their further live \nsounds at this venue at a later date. @) \nSINGLES OF THE FORTNIGHT -Micheal Duffy \nco.uk -'Influenced' \nco.uk's infectious pop punk is the latest noise to be grab­\nbing some attention north of the border. \nThe Belfast threesome have been going down very well on \nthe live circuit of late and its easy to see why on their debut sin­\ngle 'Influenced'. \nConsidering their sound is nothing revolutionary, the title of \nthe single is rather apt. Their guitar riffs are very Kerbdog-esque , \nalthough it lacks the edgeiness of the now defunct Kilkenny trio. \nThe inevitable American influences are prominent, and parts of \nthe song are something akin to material on Green Day's multi­\nmillion selling album, 'Dookie', with shades of Stone Temple \nPilots also recognisable. \nNorthern Ireland has a habit of throwing up international \nsuccessful acts, and reports have co.uk following in the footsteps \nof Therapy? and Ash already. The boys recorded this single at \nHomestead studios were Therapy? launched themselves from, \nand with Bright Star Recordings putting their weight behind them, \nco.uk have alot going for them. \nThe b-side, 'Part of the Game' is perhaps an even better \ntrack than the single itself, and if their catalogue of songs are as \ngood as these two, keep an eye out for co.uk . ( 8/10) \n(our Lady Peace -'Superman's Dead.' ) \nii you only buy one single this fortnight, make sure its this \none. Our Lady's Peace have finally decided to hit the British mar­\nket, and about time to. \nHaving sold over three million records across the Atlantic in \nthe last year, these Canadian legends have had no desire to \nenter the fickle European market to date, but with their album due \nfor release shortly here they have finally taken the plunge. \n'Superman's dead' is the best single of the year so far and \nshould go along way in to making them a household name. \nIts brilliantly intertwined stop-start guitar work incorporating \nacoustic and electric guitar, together with its brilliant lyrics and the \nsubliminal vocals of Arnold Lanni let you know why there's a \nrepeat button on your CD player. \nSigned to corporate giants Sony, Our Lady Peace should \nget the exposure they deserve, and should definitely get an airing \non an MTV near you very soon. \nBands like Third Eye Blind and Marcy Playgound have \nthreatened in the last few months to be America's, or even \nCanada 's next big thing over here. Our Lady Peace deserve the \naccolade, and just might get it. \nLanni's whines during the chorus, \"Superman's dead, he's \nliving in my head.\" If he's in there, I can't wait for the album. \n(10/10) \nSound marks of the nineties \n( DAVID GRAY: A CENTURY ENDS . ) \nThere are but two types of people in this world : those who \nhaven't heard of David Gray and those who love him. If you are \nof the latter persuasion find something else to do and don't waste \nyour time reading this as you know what I'm about to say, if you \nare of the former, shame!, shame on you, but do not fear as \nredemption is at hand. \nGray, born in Manchester but brought up in Wales, so impressed \nPolydor A&R man , Rob Holden with his demo that Holden quit his \njob to become his \nmanager. The poten­\ntial which prompted \nthis impetuosity is ful­\nfilled on Gray's first \nalbum: A Century Ends \nreleased in 1993 on \nthe Hut label. You get \nthe feeling from Gray's \nnaked lyrics, delivery, \nand arrangements that \nthis guy means what \nhe says, and that what \nhe says means some­\nthing -there's no \"ooh \nbaby\"s or \"wot you like?\"s in here. Gathering Dust, perhaps the \nmost evocative song ever written by a Welshman, is so honest \nand heart rending that you can't help but feel for Gray in his mis­\nery and confusion. From the outset you become enveloped in \nGray's world, a world of hope (Shine), decay (A Century Ends, \nLet The Truth Sing) and casual sex (Debauchery, Lead Me \nUpstairs), a world, which if you wanted to you could not escape \nfrom such is Gray's genius. @) \n!9\"DP21",

You can't \nhelp but get a bit paranoid when they look at you \"aw oh, \nhe knows what I'm thinking -oh no he heard that -ah can \nyou hear me stop looking .... \". After the initial relief of \nAdam Higgs saying that the spirit world can't talk through \nhim at the dr0p of a hat and that he would need deep con­\ncentration for this I relaxed slightly knowing that my ole \nGrand Uncle couldn't give out to me for not going to his \nremoval.

After a bit of pleading \nMr. Gibson promised not to read me any more as I was \nfeeling slightly naked which isn't conducive to a good inter­\nview. \nFergus Gibson is a bubbly character and is as enthusiastic \n-\\· .; \n,\\t _, ... , \n~ ... '1 ·' \n~ -.;,,i• •: • I \nin real life as he is on TV -but isn't annoying in real life \n(sorry Fergus) his energy is infectious and you do want to \nbelieve when talking to him as you begin to like the guy. \nHe first realised that he had a gift at the age of 6 years \nwhen he told his mother about the dark colours he saw \naround a boy at school and felt that something bad was \ngoing to happen. When the next day young Master Gibson \narrived into school to hear that the same class mate had \ndied of an asthma attack he knew he had something. \nAdam Higgs can remember talking to spirits from as early \nas 12 years old, he then joined what is called a \"Circle \" \nwhere he was trained to develop his skills and use them \nproperly. He claims that \"loads of people have the gift to \ncommunicate with the spirit world maybe only a little bit \" \nbut they need to develop this gift and train it to work to its \nfull potential. Mr. Higgs claims to be able to talk to spirits \nand has \"guides\" who train him as he goes. Each level of \nlearning in the sprit world has different guides which are \nspirits that speak to him and advise him on things and how \nto improve his gift. Both Gibson and Higgs are adamant \nthat nobody dies as such but they merely leave their bodies \nand keep. their spirits -however, anxious as I was not to get \ninvolved in a religious debate, the mater of religion and \nhow the ·their work fitted into it was only skirted upon. \nSuffice to say there's a whole day's work in it. \nGibson's work is different to Higgs, while Higgs enables \ndrop17 \ncontact with the spirit world for anyone who is \"willing to \nbelieve\" Gibson can read into what kind of person you are \nand were you are going in life. The crystal ball is used as a \nkind of an earth if you like -to earth the energy field \naround a person's body and to make someone's aura eqsier \nto see. He reads palms and can only also read the Tarot \ncards. He is also an astrologist and has been in practice as \nsuch for over 20 years. \nWhen asked about qualifications and society membership \netc. the two respond that while they are not part of an Irish \nsociety per se but are trying to set one up. They attended \nconferences and seminars on their work and are now inter­\nested in setting up workshops to help people with their gifts \nto develop them. \"we are starting workshops in September \nto train people in psychic awareness ... we will help people \nchannel their energies if they want to do it .... \"Gibson \nremarks. \nOn the issue of sceptics Gibson remarks \" I was the biggest \nsceptic of all\" stating that when he first met his colleague he \nthought he was a fake but was quickly corrected when his \ndeceased father started telling him a few things through the \nmedium of Mr. Higgs, \"all we'll say is come with an open \nmind and you'll get results ... \" \nAs for the people leaving the session they didn't seem dis­\nsatisfied and definitely didn't stop the people outside from \nforking out £20 to speak to one of the two people inside. I \nleft a believer I have to admit however after thinking about it \nmore and more I realised I was looking for explanations as \nto why I had to forgive and began to make so many com­\nparisons I realised I was hoping that what was said made \nsense. A week later it still doesn't make perfect sense - I \ndon't need to forgive at all!!! @",

          "text": "SOCCER ROCKER \nAs the world cup fades into the distance for another four years \ndropping off the multitude of event junkies at some specialist \nBetty Ford Clinic, one is left to contemplate a few harsh reali­\nties. Firstly Holland who for my money were the best team in \nthe tournament this summer didn't make it to the final -let \nalo.ne win the thing. Penalty Kicks are a cruel Russian Roulette \n-mostly despised by footballers who have to take part in them \n~nd mostly loved and devoured by the neutral observer. I've \nsaid before on this page that penalties should be taken not \nnecessarily by your star strikers but by whoever has the balls \nto and, as they say, is \"up for it\". I have defended the \ncourage of Gareth Southgate and I am now commending \nDavid Batty for having the guts to have a go. Unfortunately \nfor him, his shot was saved and England went out. \nWhen Holland and Brazil went to penalties however, I was \ngobsmacked at a couple of players who raised their hands \nand deemed themselves willing to take one and even more \ngobsmacked by some who did not. Once again I'll say fair \nplay to Cocu (who incidentally had scored in an earlier game) \nand Ronald De Boer for having a go and congratulations to \nBrazilian Keeper Tafferal for saving them, but both shots could \nhave quite safely be filed under the same heading as \"defend­\ner's efforts\". The question is where were Holland's Hitmen? \nWith the exception of Dennis Bergkamp the entire Dutch attack \nsat down on the centre circle and stared at the grass hoping \nnot to be asked to take one and only got up lo link arms in a \nshow of unity after the five players had been nominated. \nWhere oh where was Patrick Kluivert? Pierre Van Hooijdunk? \nEdgar Davids? Clarence Seedorf? Marc Overmars?? Why \nwasn't a defender taken off in the dying seconds of extra time \nand Jimmy Floyd Hasselbank sent on to take one?? I mean I \nknow hindsight is an absolutely wonderful tool to win a match \nwith, but look at the list again, they can't all have had \nButterflies in their thummies surely? Nor can that lot have \nmade it in their career without having taken a spot before. \ndrop18 \nSecondly (there was a firstly about two paragraphs back), \nMick McCarthy's Republic of Ireland side will not in all proba­\nbility be going to the Euro 2000 finals in Belgium and Holland \nin just under two years time. Ireland's next competitive game \nis against Croatia in Landsdowne road in the Autumn . On the \nbasis of what we've seen of the Croats in the World Cup, \nIreland's enthusiasm, youth and raw talent will not be enough \nfor this team who came third in the World cup finals without \nthe aid of their star striker, Boben. But alas Boban expects to \nbe fit and ready just in time to make it for ... you've guessed \nit ... Dublin. \nYugoslavia who were beaten by a last minute goal by the \nDutch in the second round are also in our group and are also \nlooking like a team who could kick the arses off our boys in \ngreen if they're not very careful. If we have any hope against \nthese teams it's that neither look anything like infallible defen­\nsively. With that said though I still maintain that our best hope \nof making it to Euro 2000 lies in the volatile political land­\nscape that is the Balkans. Therefore the onus is on each and \nevery football loving Irishman and Irishwoman to do all that is \nwithin their power to fan the flames of war in that troubled \npart of the world ... nothing too nasty mind you ... just enough to \nget Yugoslavia, Croatia and Macedonia booted out of the \ncompetition. That will leave Ireland only needing to over come \nthe mighty Malta. Till the next time ....... Niall Quinn. @",

A spark gets ignited, plenty of \nlucid soundb,tes ore exchanged and the world is left with on \ninterview the public, writer ond his gleeful respondent will read, \nre-read and generally get o whole heap of ever increasing kicks \nfrom. When this happens our media not only justifies its own \nsometimes intrusive existence, but our mediators {the journalists) \nprovide what moy tentatively be coiled a valuable service. \nNow at this point I'm sure your obit bofAed os to why I'm \ndeconstructing the labours of journalism ond not getting on with \nanother good old fashioned rant about wheel bases, wind tunnels \nand the vagaries of errant horse power. Well in truth its quite \nsimple really. I'm preluding o defence of Dornon Hill's so for \nlacklustre season {up to now that is, the time of writing, which is \njust prior to the British Grand Prix). You see for most of 1998 \nthere hos been o rather dork and gloomy cloud hanging over his \ncareer. He's gone from racing in 1997 with the promising but \nunderachieving TWR Arrows team to racing this year with the \nequally promising but under achieving Jordon outfit. A dearth of \ndecent results and the not unoccossionol experience of seeing his \nteam moles out qualify this ex-World Champion have led to many \na commentator expressing doubts not only over Damon's staying \npower but also in regard to his actual ability. Its frustrating for \nHill and infuriating for his followers, most of whom will point out \nthat it's not Dornon whose slowed down but the cars in which he's \nbeen travelling. A reasonable argument I suppose. Neither the \nJordon nor the TWR Arrows chassis have shown much in the woy \nof race winning speed, so fair enough. But for me the best evi­\ndence of Damon's real pace is contained in on immaculately con­\nceived interview he did some years ago with that hard old hack \nof English weeklies, Nigel Roebuck. \nIt was just prior to that year's Monie Corio Grand Prix and \nHill, the then William's driver, having been asked to chauffeur \nyoung Nigel down through the twists and turns of Monaco's \nsprawling coastline obliged to do so in one of his team's pleasant \nif rather sedentary (for an Fl driver anyway) Renault Lagunas. \nGreat thought Roebuck, there's no way on earth Hill can drive this \nthing like a sports car, cause it ain't one, and so no fear of \nDamon exiting corners at impossible speeds, scaring his hapless \npassenger senseless and thus nullifying the chances of a coherent \ninterview. As everyone knows -well they will after I tell them -\nthere is nothing quite as bad as trying to ask a few probing ques­\ntions while the man you're talking to does his utmost to stay well \noutside the speed limit and as much as possible entirely within \nthe farther reaches of his own personal best. It just can't be \ndone. \nIt was unfortunate then for Nigel tho! on this occasion \nDornon just happened to be in the mood for burning rubber, \nstretching parameters ond challenging the dynamics of adhe­\nsion. Nigel couldn't ever recoil such o sensation of complete \nond utter mind bending speed os that which Dornon supplied. \nCorners were os nothing, straights o blur ond with Roebuck hav­\ning shut his eyes in o panic of terror, blind bends were .... well, \ner ... blind. Neither could he remember much of the actual inter-\nW:~~~~,~1~~,~t,r~: \nview, fear having washed it from his mind, so it wasn't until later \nthat night {in the comfort of his stationary hotel room and with \nthe assistance of several glasses of Scotch) that he found time to \nrewind the lope and listen back. What struck him most was \nhow jittery and shaky his own voice was as against the fluid, \nassured and articulate responses from Damon. Hill was basical­\nly an insatiable speed merchant, on top of his game and without \nfear. \nGoing against all the odds the printed piece proved mag­\nnificent, an interview of the highest calibre. It highlighted not \nonl~ how good Roebuck was at his trade but equally how pro­\nfess1on~I and capable Damon was at his own. More poignantly \nthough 11 showed to the world that while Damon might at times \nlack the proper equipment one thing we should never doubt is \nhis unrelenting thirst for speed. @) \ndrop18",

          "text": "wheels \nof steel \nMichael Lehane reviews the Tour's visit to Ireland ....... . \nA certain reverence surrounds the Tour De France which \ninspires greatness. Sean Kelly pointed this out when he \nsaid \"You think back sometimes to the races you've rid­\nden earlier in the season and it seems that you were \nonly riding to 85% of your limits. You didn't think it at \nthe time but when you ride the tour you know. This is a \nI 00% race\". The Tour coming to Ireland has already \nhelped create greatness. Paul Kimmage wrote the finest \npiece of sports prose last week when he recalled the \nmemory of Shay Elliot the first Irish man to wear the \nMailot Jaune, way back in 1963. This is a race that feeds \nbrilliance; look at Chris Boardman, an off form rider \ncoming into the tour last Saturday yet in this milieu he \nmanaged to win his third prologue in a convincing man­\nner. \nIt is a pity then that RTE failed to present a preview with a degree \nof substance. The Eurovision-type charade hosted by Mary Kenny \nand Stephen Roche was far too heavily dependent on pre-record­\ned material, but what was more frustrating about the show was \nthe short amount of time given over to Sean Kelly the fourth best \ntour rider of all time, competing as he did in 14 tours. Even more \ndisturbing than this is the failure to recognise other Irish riders \nwho competed in the tour over the last 15 years, these riders \nwere; Martin Early (who won the Pau stage in 1989), Paul \nKimmage and Laurence Roche. The former two riders achieved \nwhat many cyclist dream off when they completed the race in \n1986 and 1991 respectively. It was a grossly insulting act on the \npart of RTE not to invite these men on stage at Dublin Castle. \nJust to keep the negative tone in vogue, lets deal with the latest \ndrug related story surrounding the race. Cycling is a sport which \nis constantly back pedalling in relation to drug abuse. Blood tests \nhave been introduced but what could Willy Voet masseur with the \nFestina team, have in store for the 400 vials of illegal drugs found \nin his car two days before the Tour began? Unfortunately this inci­\ndent is just another symptom of a deeply rooted problems which \nhas plagued the sport. \nNonetheless, behind this malign barricade there lies a glorious \nrace which produces a constant glamour fused with excellence. \nNot even a rain filled Dublin Saturday can quench such glamour. \nDenis Le Proux, was the first rider to negotiate the 5.6Km pro­\nlogue route. His time of 6.43 sec's was the time to beat. The \njourney men riders and then the good domesiques (team wor~­\ners) started to roll off the ramp. The rain stopped the road dried \nand the crowds swelled as the quality riders began to emerge. \nFestina's Christophe Moreau set the most impressive early time of \n6:17.29.Then the big boys began to come down the ramp.Julich \nwas the first to get inside Moreau's time when he clocked in at \n6: 17:28. Then roll on Chris Boardman, the time trial specialist; his \ntime of 6: 12:36 seconds was categorical and last year's winner Jan \nUllrich could only manage a top 6 placing. So, Boardman as pre­\ndicted by this column wins the prologue with his precise measur­\ning of power, breaking and bravery. He got all three jerseys as the \nclouds left Dublin and Bertie Ahern smiled a smile befitting the \nworld's largest moving circus. \nDay two and fog hovers over the Dublin mountains. A massive \nday of sport lies in wait. There is a Munster Hurling Final, a \nGrand Prix, a World Cup Final and the Tour's first stage which is \nstarting and finishing in Dublin. The official start at Dundrum saw \nan Emotional Stephen Roche honoured in his home village. The \nfirst climb of the race is the \"Col de Wicklow Gap \".As the climb \nintensified flags blew in a versatile mass of colour as Zanin gri­\nmaced and summoned enough energy to win the mountain sprint, \nthus securing the Polka Dot jersey. \nIn Blessington Durand won the sprint and was joined by Van Hyfte \nas they broke and remained in the lead until the group reeled \nthem in outside Tallaght. With the Phoenix Park sprint nearing, \nCipollini (super Mario) looked as if he might deliver. Boardman's \nteam worked to protect him, unfortunately for Copolini, he and \nhis team mates collided and ended up sprawled out along the flat \nsurface. Tom Steels got the better of Zabel at the finish and won \nthe stage. Boardman finished with a smile on his face as he \nretained the Golden Fleece. \nOn day three there was Yellow every where, there were even \nFrench police on the street as a voice incessantly sang \"Le Tour de \nFrance\". The crowds lined up from Patrick Street to County hall \nin Cork. As the publicity cavalcade just arrived in Cork Chris \nBoardman crashed and watched another tour end early for him. \nThe race itself came out ofYoughal with Boardman's team mates \nmaking a break in honour of their leader. Then there as another \npile up as the peloton reached Tivoli. The race didn't stop and \nSpiarido came in the winner of the brisk stage however once again \nthis column gets the overall leader right with Zabel taking over as \nrace leader. \nIn an almost clinical style \"Tour de France en lrlande\" was sudden­\nly over. The event was bottled and corked and sent on its way \nback to Roscoff. Another 3,800 KM has to be negotiated. The \nserious stuff will begin when the fortunes of the riders will ebb \nand flow before they race up the Champs Elysees on August 2nd. \nPlenty more to be written about this tour yet, but if you want to \nmake some money then back Olano at ten to one, it could be as \nrewarding as a stage win! well not really. @) \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the tour de france \nin Ireland \ndrop20 \n_t \nCT \nTl \nB \ne, \nSC \nfr \na \ns \nrr \na \nu \nh \nV. \n0 \ntt \n\"I \ns \nh \nb \na \nir \n0 \ne \ns \nF \nV",

          "text": "J. \n( Limrock Profiles........ ) \nThis week Ronan Hennessy talks to local band PATROL. .... \nBaggy , \"Madchester'' and all those memorable sounds of the \nearly 90' s dance/rock crossover ... are Patrol its lineal succes­\nsors? Well these are the sort of things that matter to Patrol's \nfrontmen Johnny \nand Ronan C. \nSince their for­\nmation one year \nago this relatively \nunknown band \nhave immerged \nwith the intention \nof spear-heading \nthis so called \n\"Baggy\" renais­\nsance. They \nhave reason to \nbe anxious after \nall they are bear­\ning the reputation \nof this once leg­\nendary music \nsound while attempting to breathe valuable life into it. \nRonan is mad for it and the strength of his bands music together \nwith his own convictions are testimony of this. Patrol could easily \nshake off the Stone Roses tag but will others notice this vital \ndetachment? Of course with songs like \"Super Vague Dowie\" \nand \"Rapid Belly\" one should recognize this all important individ­\nuality. The band however are more certain about their mus ic. \nRonan hopes they'll be bigger than Asian \"Cos they are a great \nIrish band d'you whatha I mean\". \nPatrol are determined to put a more objective feel to the some­\ntimes muted expression wh ich is music. \"When I read Carl Jung \nor Nietzsche things just fall into place but still I'm still a lad d'you \nknow, I believe in intuition cos I'm not goin' subscribing to the \nbackwater of contrived masculinity I don't pretend and I don't \nread Loaded magazine\". \nTaking a band who seem so much in the know their knowledge \nof Limrock is suprisingly scant. Ronan says \"Yeah we are local \nband but maybe not in touch, I mean people go on about \nFigment but I never heard of them\". \nJohnny sees the band as hard working and generally steady with \na full year of practice and demo behind their backs but is only \nready to declare that unlike the \"Celtic tiger'' they are not exclu­\nsive . \"We truly love everyone\". \nPatrol will play alongside Box , Amber and Mosaic in a July 19 \nfixture at Costellos . \nCatch them waxing lyrical there or check out their further live \nsounds at this venue at a later date. @) \nSINGLES OF THE FORTNIGHT -Micheal Duffy \nco.uk -'Influenced' \nco.uk's infectious pop punk is the latest noise to be grab­\nbing some attention north of the border. \nThe Belfast threesome have been going down very well on \nthe live circuit of late and its easy to see why on their debut sin­\ngle 'Influenced'. \nConsidering their sound is nothing revolutionary, the title of \nthe single is rather apt. Their guitar riffs are very Kerbdog-esque , \nalthough it lacks the edgeiness of the now defunct Kilkenny trio. \nThe inevitable American influences are prominent, and parts of \nthe song are something akin to material on Green Day's multi­\nmillion selling album, 'Dookie', with shades of Stone Temple \nPilots also recognisable. \nNorthern Ireland has a habit of throwing up international \nsuccessful acts, and reports have co.uk following in the footsteps \nof Therapy? and Ash already. The boys recorded this single at \nHomestead studios were Therapy? launched themselves from, \nand with Bright Star Recordings putting their weight behind them, \nco.uk have alot going for them. \nThe b-side, 'Part of the Game' is perhaps an even better \ntrack than the single itself, and if their catalogue of songs are as \ngood as these two, keep an eye out for co.uk . ( 8/10) \n(our Lady Peace -'Superman's Dead.' ) \nii you only buy one single this fortnight, make sure its this \none. Our Lady's Peace have finally decided to hit the British mar­\nket, and about time to. \nHaving sold over three million records across the Atlantic in \nthe last year, these Canadian legends have had no desire to \nenter the fickle European market to date, but with their album due \nfor release shortly here they have finally taken the plunge. \n'Superman's dead' is the best single of the year so far and \nshould go along way in to making them a household name. \nIts brilliantly intertwined stop-start guitar work incorporating \nacoustic and electric guitar, together with its brilliant lyrics and the \nsubliminal vocals of Arnold Lanni let you know why there's a \nrepeat button on your CD player. \nSigned to corporate giants Sony, Our Lady Peace should \nget the exposure they deserve, and should definitely get an airing \non an MTV near you very soon. \nBands like Third Eye Blind and Marcy Playgound have \nthreatened in the last few months to be America's, or even \nCanada 's next big thing over here. Our Lady Peace deserve the \naccolade, and just might get it. \nLanni's whines during the chorus, \"Superman's dead, he's \nliving in my head.\" If he's in there, I can't wait for the album. \n(10/10) \nSound marks of the nineties \n( DAVID GRAY: A CENTURY ENDS . ) \nThere are but two types of people in this world : those who \nhaven't heard of David Gray and those who love him. If you are \nof the latter persuasion find something else to do and don't waste \nyour time reading this as you know what I'm about to say, if you \nare of the former, shame!, shame on you, but do not fear as \nredemption is at hand. \nGray, born in Manchester but brought up in Wales, so impressed \nPolydor A&R man , Rob Holden with his demo that Holden quit his \njob to become his \nmanager. The poten­\ntial which prompted \nthis impetuosity is ful­\nfilled on Gray's first \nalbum: A Century Ends \nreleased in 1993 on \nthe Hut label. You get \nthe feeling from Gray's \nnaked lyrics, delivery, \nand arrangements that \nthis guy means what \nhe says, and that what \nhe says means some­\nthing -there's no \"ooh \nbaby\"s or \"wot you like?\"s in here. Gathering Dust, perhaps the \nmost evocative song ever written by a Welshman, is so honest \nand heart rending that you can't help but feel for Gray in his mis­\nery and confusion. From the outset you become enveloped in \nGray's world, a world of hope (Shine), decay (A Century Ends, \nLet The Truth Sing) and casual sex (Debauchery, Lead Me \nUpstairs), a world, which if you wanted to you could not escape \nfrom such is Gray's genius. @) \n!9\"DP21",

' ', \n•.tp/'·~~~a;: ~n·~-w~~h~n ·~;e for/h~ men Gillian Cha~ke \nA profiles whats hot in men's fashion this season. \n.J \n:J FOR MEN \nThis week we take a look at the new trends in men's fashion and \nfashion accessories for the summer/autumn of'98 .. \nTweed suit; Unlike the cumbersome creations found in the \nwardrobes of ageing toffs, these lightweight designs go for style in \nplace of bulk. The single-breasted wool tweed suit is coming back to \nhaunt us. Jersey shirts; In the spring you'll have bought the short­\nsleeved version, now its time to go long, especially if the Irish sum­\nmer we are experiencing this \nyear continues. Corduroy; In \njackets, shorts and trousers, \nmaking a comeback after a \nlong, long absence. Although \nsome of you out there know \nit was a winner and didn't dis­\ncard a single cord!. Brown or \nnavy corduroy zip-up jackets \nwill always make a statement. \nBurgundy; For so long an old \nman 's colour, the craze for all \nthings Seventies has swept \nburgundy back in. Go for \nchunky wool knit burgundy \njumpers and burgundy wool \ntrousers. Combat pants; \nThe stride that's giving the five­\npocket Jean a run for its money . Whether you choose the shiny vis­\ncose look or the dull cotton, either will get you noticed. \nLeather; Instant tough for even the weediest individual, worn in \nblack or brown or burgundy as was seen as part of Louise Kennedy's \n\"Luvvly Jubbly\" collection. Styles include suit cuts, bomber jackets or \nloose like a car coat. Another good buy this year is the double­\nbreasted short trench sheepskins in, yes, brown. Go raid your Dad's \ncloset and you just might find what you are looking for. \nACCESSORIES \nGold jewellery; After lengthy domination of the accessory market \nby the metal known as silver, gold is back. Tip: try to avoid the \"Mr. T\" \nlook. Go for the more wealthy \nman about town appearance \nwith heavy gold link and solid \ngold square design bracelets, \nand the classic gold cufflinks. \nShades; Snowboard-influenced \nwraparound sunglasses with \ncamouflage design or for the \nrockstar look, black horn­\nrimmed frames with yellow \nlens. There may not be any sun \nto keep out but you will look \nsuper cool. Nokia phone and \npersonal computer; An office \nin your pocket on even the \nremotest of mountains, although they have been making them more \ncompact these days. No look is complete this season without a high­\ntech gadget of some shape and form. \nHi-tech watches; Indestructible and posing a severe threat to the \nworld's metal reserves, these are watches at the cutting edge of \ntime-telling. Formula I watch with orange face or the new phycho­\nkenetic by Seiko, well worth half a grand. Whatever next? Electric \nshavers; This year's essential accessory. If you don' have the dosh to \ngo out and buy one then just pre­\ntend it's your birthday and get \nyour friend to buy one for you. \nIn the coming weeks we speak \nwith Marc O'Neill who is \nregarded as one of Ireland's most \ncontemporary and saleable \ndesigners. \nBorn in 1970, Marc first studied \nat the National College of Art \nand Design in Dublin, from \nwhere he graduated in 1993 with \nan honours degree in Fashion \nDesign. His designs are focused \naround clean cut tailoring with \nattention to detail, and is acces­\nsorised with co-ordinates and separates such as masculine shirts, tai­\nlored and unstructured dresses, knitwear, jersey, and leather. \nOne of Marc's evening wear outfits shall be on show at the 1998 Miss \nLimerick pageant on Tuesday 14th next. He has most generously \ndonated one of his evening wear outfits to Drop's Miss Limerick repre­\nsentative Ms . Gillian Sheehan. Go Girl. @",

          "text": "You just can't help yourself.You have to like Harrison Ford. \nHe 's the most successful film actor of all time. Three Star \nWars, three Indiana Jones, two Tom Clancys (and all of these \nhave further instalments in the pipeline), plus so many other \nmajor once-offs like Witness, Blade Runner, Working Girl, \nSabrina. He doesn't make turkeys, all he has to do is show up \nand the film makes more than all of Madonna 's efforts put \ntogether. So it's official. Everybody likes Harrison Ford. No \nsurprise then that his latest \"Six Days, Seven Nights\" is a \nbig hit, director Ivan Reitman's second biggest opener (and \nthat's impressive; he's done Twins, Ghostbusters, \nKindergarten Cop ... ). It's an adventure-comedy-romance \nkinda thing. Ford (a low rent pilot) and Anne Heche (Girls in \nPrison 1994.Thought we 'd forgotten.Anne?) crash-land on a \ndeserted island in the Caribbean and have to survive heat, \nscorpions, pirates and, predictably, each other. Harrison, who \nnever plays far from type, goes out on a limb here to play a \nkind of drunken comic bum for at least· the first ten min­\nutes, before regressing to his sober, laconic, irascible, love­\nable down-to-earth regular hero-guy. Notable are the ref­\nerences to his now quite advanced age (the actual digits are \nwhispered in Heche's ear, but I know he's 57 since July \n13th) wh ich, in true Hollywood style, contrasts markedly to \nhis love interest's mere 29 years. \nTraditionally no mention of age difference is made when \nthe male star is the elder (like, say, Hitchcock's Vertigo \nwhere James Stewart is 50 and Kim Novak is 24). The \nmovie itself is pleasant enough without becoming likeable. \nThe cardboard cu_t-out bad-guys and the \"screwball\" antics \nof David Schwimmer are pretty tired material for an A-list \nfeature. But I guess when over here we're getting cheated \nout of another summer , it's hard to resist the azure sky and \nluke-warm water along a tropical beach. Kilkee was never \nlike this. Is this how Ford manages to get a holiday while \nfilming? Good man Harrison! You have to like the guy. \nSome things you may not have known about Harrison Ford: \n(I) there was a silent screen actor ?f;_ that name who died \nin 1957 (2) he was in Apocalypse·~ow (3) he was in \nDynasty (4) his first film was in James Coburn 's bank heist \nmovie Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round in 1966 (5) he has \nreceived only one Academy Award Nomination for Best \nActor (he'll get the Lifetime Achievement Oscar in twenty \nyears time) (6) he was born in Chicago. \nMimic is a cheap horror flick along the lines of last year's \nRelic. Mira Sorvino sleepwalks her way through the by-the­\nnumbers schlock script.\"which is filled with surly black cops \nwith a heart of gold, cute ghetto kids who collect bugs \ninstead of shooting up with heroin. As with all movies of \nthis type, the emphasis is on special effects rather than plot \nor dialogue, but here the result is a colossal let-down as \nthe \"bug-men\" are merely bargain basement variations on \nHR Gieger's Alien.And the climactic scene is stolen directly \nfrom it's sequel.Aliens. Even just thinking about world-class \nhorrors like Alien, Hellraiser, Predator, Halloween should \nhave convinced the producers not to bother. But both,er \nthey did, sigh. \nA quick quiz. What do all these people have in common: \nUma Thurman.Al Pacino, David Strathairn, Rutger Hauer, \nMadeline Stowe, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Eric \nStoltz, Laura Dern, Faye Dunaway, Richard Pryor and Roger \nDaltrey. Thinking caps on ... come on now . Anyone? Well, \nyou'll have to ask me in the street because I'm not telling. @",

      "raw_text": "J. \n( Limrock Profiles........ ) \nThis week Ronan Hennessy talks to local band PATROL. .... \nBaggy , \"Madchester'' and all those memorable sounds of the \nearly 90' s dance/rock crossover ... are Patrol its lineal succes­\nsors? Well these are the sort of things that matter to Patrol's \nfrontmen Johnny \nand Ronan C. \nSince their for­\nmation one year \nago this relatively \nunknown band \nhave immerged \nwith the intention \nof spear-heading \nthis so called \n\"Baggy\" renais­\nsance. They \nhave reason to \nbe anxious after \nall they are bear­\ning the reputation \nof this once leg­\nendary music \nsound while attempting to breathe valuable life into it. \nRonan is mad for it and the strength of his bands music together \nwith his own convictions are testimony of this. Patrol could easily \nshake off the Stone Roses tag but will others notice this vital \ndetachment? Of course with songs like \"Super Vague Dowie\" \nand \"Rapid Belly\" one should recognize this all important individ­\nuality. The band however are more certain about their mus ic. \nRonan hopes they'll be bigger than Asian \"Cos they are a great \nIrish band d'you whatha I mean\". \nPatrol are determined to put a more objective feel to the some­\ntimes muted expression wh ich is music. \"When I read Carl Jung \nor Nietzsche things just fall into place but still I'm still a lad d'you \nknow, I believe in intuition cos I'm not goin' subscribing to the \nbackwater of contrived masculinity I don't pretend and I don't \nread Loaded magazine\". \nTaking a band who seem so much in the know their knowledge \nof Limrock is suprisingly scant. Ronan says \"Yeah we are local \nband but maybe not in touch, I mean people go on about \nFigment but I never heard of them\". \nJohnny sees the band as hard working and generally steady with \na full year of practice and demo behind their backs but is only \nready to declare that unlike the \"Celtic tiger'' they are not exclu­\nsive . \"We truly love everyone\". \nPatrol will play alongside Box , Amber and Mosaic in a July 19 \nfixture at Costellos . \nCatch them waxing lyrical there or check out their further live \nsounds at this venue at a later date. @) \nSINGLES OF THE FORTNIGHT -Micheal Duffy \nco.uk -'Influenced' \nco.uk's infectious pop punk is the latest noise to be grab­\nbing some attention north of the border. \nThe Belfast threesome have been going down very well on \nthe live circuit of late and its easy to see why on their debut sin­\ngle 'Influenced'. \nConsidering their sound is nothing revolutionary, the title of \nthe single is rather apt. Their guitar riffs are very Kerbdog-esque , \nalthough it lacks the edgeiness of the now defunct Kilkenny trio. \nThe inevitable American influences are prominent, and parts of \nthe song are something akin to material on Green Day's multi­\nmillion selling album, 'Dookie', with shades of Stone Temple \nPilots also recognisable. \nNorthern Ireland has a habit of throwing up international \nsuccessful acts, and reports have co.uk following in the footsteps \nof Therapy? and Ash already. The boys recorded this single at \nHomestead studios were Therapy? launched themselves from, \nand with Bright Star Recordings putting their weight behind them, \nco.uk have alot going for them. \nThe b-side, 'Part of the Game' is perhaps an even better \ntrack than the single itself, and if their catalogue of songs are as \ngood as these two, keep an eye out for co.uk . ( 8/10) \n(our Lady Peace -'Superman's Dead.' ) \nii you only buy one single this fortnight, make sure its this \none. Our Lady's Peace have finally decided to hit the British mar­\nket, and about time to. \nHaving sold over three million records across the Atlantic in \nthe last year, these Canadian legends have had no desire to \nenter the fickle European market to date, but with their album due \nfor release shortly here they have finally taken the plunge. \n'Superman's dead' is the best single of the year so far and \nshould go along way in to making them a household name. \nIts brilliantly intertwined stop-start guitar work incorporating \nacoustic and electric guitar, together with its brilliant lyrics and the \nsubliminal vocals of Arnold Lanni let you know why there's a \nrepeat button on your CD player. \nSigned to corporate giants Sony, Our Lady Peace should \nget the exposure they deserve, and should definitely get an airing \non an MTV near you very soon. \nBands like Third Eye Blind and Marcy Playgound have \nthreatened in the last few months to be America's, or even \nCanada 's next big thing over here. Our Lady Peace deserve the \naccolade, and just might get it. \nLanni's whines during the chorus, \"Superman's dead, he's \nliving in my head.\" If he's in there, I can't wait for the album. \n(10/10) \nSound marks of the nineties \n( DAVID GRAY: A CENTURY ENDS . ) \nThere are but two types of people in this world : those who \nhaven't heard of David Gray and those who love him. If you are \nof the latter persuasion find something else to do and don't waste \nyour time reading this as you know what I'm about to say, if you \nare of the former, shame!, shame on you, but do not fear as \nredemption is at hand. \nGray, born in Manchester but brought up in Wales, so impressed \nPolydor A&R man , Rob Holden with his demo that Holden quit his \njob to become his \nmanager. The poten­\ntial which prompted \nthis impetuosity is ful­\nfilled on Gray's first \nalbum: A Century Ends \nreleased in 1993 on \nthe Hut label. You get \nthe feeling from Gray's \nnaked lyrics, delivery, \nand arrangements that \nthis guy means what \nhe says, and that what \nhe says means some­\nthing -there's no \"ooh \nbaby\"s or \"wot you like?\"s in here. Gathering Dust, perhaps the \nmost evocative song ever written by a Welshman, is so honest \nand heart rending that you can't help but feel for Gray in his mis­\nery and confusion. From the outset you become enveloped in \nGray's world, a world of hope (Shine), decay (A Century Ends, \nLet The Truth Sing) and casual sex (Debauchery, Lead Me \nUpstairs), a world, which if you wanted to you could not escape \nfrom such is Gray's genius. @) \n!9\"DP21",

      "chunk_text": "FOUR WHEELS AND A WIND \nTUNNEL -an F1 column from \nour point of view! \nLatest Drop recruit, Formula \nOne mad Hoss Carney, argues \npersuasively on behalf of an Irish \nGrand Prix .. Can you stretch your \nimagination for a moment? I mean \nreally stretch it? If so would you \nplease conjure up the image of 22 \nFormula one racing cars which \nbetween them , incidentally, pump . \nout well over 16,000 Brake Horse \nPower -the equivalent of near \nenough 540 Nissan Mieras. Now \nplace them on their starting blocks \nand situate this loud little scene \njust short of a start line painted \nacross the upper stretch of our \nvery own William St. The lights go \ngreen, Nora Bennis screams and \nDamon Hill makes a dive down the \ninside of Messer Schumacher to \ncleanly come out leading the inau­\ngural Irish Grand Prix which hap­\npens to be taking place right here \non the streets of Limerick. \nAm I mad to even suggest such a \nthing? The answer, believe it or \nnot, is that the possibility of our \ntiny island hosting a Grand Prix \nsometime in the new century isn't \nas far fetched as it may seem . \nMind you in the broader daylight of \ncommon sense Limerick itself \nmightn't be in their with a shout but \nsurely Cork, Dublin or Belfast \ncould satisfy all the financial, logis­\ntic and safety demands which the \nF.I.A. (the world motor sports gov­\nerning body) would place on such \na high profile event. Dublin at least \ncould cope with the influx of sports \nfans for the weekend; creating a \nsuitable race track wouldn't be \nbeyond our means either -\nMondello might be modified or \nsome suitable streets could be cor­\ndoned off to establish a temporary \ncircuit (as they do in Monaco and \nMelbourne); corporate sponsorship \nfor the show, an essential ingredi­\nent these days, couldn't be too \nhard to come by now that the \nCeltic tiger is in full swing; and I'm \nquite sure the government would \ngladly accept the odd £1 ,000,000 \ndonation in order to forgo any talk \nof disallowing tobacco advertising -\nthey say it worked with the Blair \nadministration across the water so \nwhy not here? All the other minor \nobstacles -arranging booking \nagents, planning permission, secu­\nrity, local promotion, travel agents, \netc ... -which might halt proceed­\nings if they weren't taken care of \nproperly could be dealt with by a \ndedicated committee of Irish Grand \nPrix organisers. Ergo, in theory \nthere's no reason why it couldn't \nbe done. \nThe benefits Ireland would accrue \nfrom hosting a round of the World \nChampionship would be phenome­\nnal. Money would be pumped into \nthe economy by all those race \ngoers intent on spending every last \ncent of their hard earned dosh in \nour pubs, clubs, restaurants and \nhotels. Our international profile \nwould get a healthy boost by being \non the bill of the largest TV sport in \nthe world. We here at home would \nbe able to see, hear and breathe in \nthe atmosphere of a fully fledged \nF1 weekend without having to \ncatch a ferry, take a flight or con­\nvert our entire life savings into \nDollars or Deutchmarks. And most \nimportantly Damon Hill (a content­\ned Dublin resident for the last few \nyears) would for once be able to \nwalk out his front door and catch \nthe Dart to work. \nAnd that leads us rather nicely to \nmy last point. Unlike Hungary \nwhere the whole show sets itself \nup every damned blasted Summer , \nwe here in Ireland have a major \ninterest in the workings of Grand \nPrix racing. Eddie Jordan, a native \nof leinster, owns and runs one of \nthe top five teams. E. Irvine \n(Northern Ireland) drives the sec­\nond Ferrari, a Celt called Walton is \nteam manager over at Arrows and \nquite recently Mayo born Martin \nBirrane, a former Nascar team \nowner, bought Lola Cars Ltd who \nproduce the machines for F3000, \nthe next step down from F1 and \nthe place from which many of the \nfuture Grand Prix stars will \nemerge. I could continue, but that \nwould be to labour the point. \nEssentially he \naps of us Irish work in and around \nFormula One , clearly justifying the \nestablishment of our very own race \nover here. Its in our blood and \nwe're in its veins. \nSo that's my proposal, a race for \nthe new millennium. I wish I had \nthe pull, power or whatever it is \n(money probably) to get the ball \nrolling, but I don't. My only real \nconsolation, and it should be yours \ntoo, is that if I am able to see the \nsense in this then surely Misters \nJordan, Irvine, Birrane and the rest \nare also. If so, then maybe they'll \nkick-start the project themselves. If \nnot then I'll just have to make it \nrich real quick, marry Bernie \nEcclestone's daughter (the guy \nwho pulls all the sport's strings) \nand bring the show here myself. \nNot a bad idea. Not a bad idea at \nall!",

I'm reliably informed that the seats came \nfrom either Bolton Wanderers, who I know have given seats to \nMonaghan Utd., from their now defunct Burnden Park or pos­\nsibly from Swindon Town. Due to their repulsive colour -\nnamely red, I'd guess Swindon but anyway who cares about \nmanky colours when you've a comfy bum. \nWhile Limerick have no more league games until late February, \ntheir league shield campaign got of to a disastrous start with a \n5-1 mauling b y Cobh Ramblers, though it's worth noting that \nLimerick were forced to field a seriously depleted team due to \ntheir injury ravaged squad. However, I'm sure Dave Connell \nwill not be pleased at conceding five goals to a team who have \nonly recently started to turn their poor fortunes around and \nscore goals with any kind of consistency. Also I'd be fairly sure \nthat with no disrespect to the Shield competition, that Dave \nand his assistant Fran Mullaly will be using the Shield games to \nprepare the right blend of a side for when the League recom­\nmences. \nThere no such thing as an easy group in International Football \nthese days, that is true, but there are easier groups than the \none we've been landed, Ireland for its sins has been landed in \na five team group with Croatia, Yugoslavia, Macedonian \n(remember them the poxy bastards!!) and Malta. Most are \nagreed that this is a truly rotten group with the only dis­\nsenters being football widows who may feel confidant that \ntheir mortgages are safe, the car will changed next year, they \nwill get that extension built onto the kitchen and best of all \nthey won 't be holidaying in Belgium and Holland in the year \n2000. however I always try to find a bright side of things \nwhich in this case lies in the volatile nature of the former \nYugoslavia from which our three main opponents come. Even \nin the not unlikely case of use finishing fourth in our group \nthere's every chance of a war breaking out over there again \nanyway, in which case we'd be admitted to the finals to \nreplace them. Har!!Har!! But let me not rubbish little Malta's \nchance - I can hear a ghostly George Hamilton voice as I \nwrite ... \"and Malta clear off the line yet again and its up to the \nreferee to decide how much time is to be added to an after­\nnoon of utter frustration at Lansdowne road ... \" \nOh well at least England's group is a mangy auld bitch as well. \nI can see them now .. smote by the Swedes, buggered by the \nBulgarians and pissed on by the vengeful Poles.",

Can you stretch your \nimagination for a moment? I mean \nreally stretch it? If so would you \nplease conjure up the image of 22 \nFormula one racing cars which \nbetween them , incidentally, pump . \nout well over 16,000 Brake Horse \nPower -the equivalent of near \nenough 540 Nissan Mieras. Now \nplace them on their starting blocks \nand situate this loud little scene \njust short of a start line painted \nacross the upper stretch of our \nvery own William St. The lights go \ngreen, Nora Bennis screams and \nDamon Hill makes a dive down the \ninside of Messer Schumacher to \ncleanly come out leading the inau­\ngural Irish Grand Prix which hap­\npens to be taking place right here \non the streets of Limerick. \nAm I mad to even suggest such a \nthing? The answer, believe it or \nnot, is that the possibility of our \ntiny island hosting a Grand Prix \nsometime in the new century isn't \nas far fetched as it may seem . \nMind you in the broader daylight of \ncommon sense Limerick itself \nmightn't be in their with a shout but \nsurely Cork, Dublin or Belfast \ncould satisfy all the financial, logis­\ntic and safety demands which the \nF.I.A. (the world motor sports gov­\nerning body) would place on such \na high profile event. Dublin at least \ncould cope with the influx of sports \nfans for the weekend; creating a \nsuitable race track wouldn't be \nbeyond our means either -\nMondello might be modified or \nsome suitable streets could be cor­\ndoned off to establish a temporary \ncircuit (as they do in Monaco and \nMelbourne); corporate sponsorship \nfor the show, an essential ingredi­\nent these days, couldn't be too \nhard to come by now that the \nCeltic tiger is in full swing; and I'm \nquite sure the government would \ngladly accept the odd £1 ,000,000 \ndonation in order to forgo any talk \nof disallowing tobacco advertising -\nthey say it worked with the Blair \nadministration across the water so \nwhy not here? All the other minor \nobstacles -arranging booking \nagents, planning permission, secu­\nrity, local promotion, travel agents, \netc ... -which might halt proceed­\nings if they weren't taken care of \nproperly could be dealt with by a \ndedicated committee of Irish Grand \nPrix organisers. Ergo, in theory \nthere's no reason why it couldn't \nbe done. \nThe benefits Ireland would accrue \nfrom hosting a round of the World \nChampionship would be phenome­\nnal. Money would be pumped into \nthe economy by all those race \ngoers intent on spending every last \ncent of their hard earned dosh in \nour pubs, clubs, restaurants and \nhotels. Our international profile \nwould get a healthy boost by being \non the bill of the largest TV sport in \nthe world. We here at home would \nbe able to see, hear and breathe in \nthe atmosphere of a fully fledged \nF1 weekend without having to \ncatch a ferry, take a flight or con­\nvert our entire life savings into \nDollars or Deutchmarks. And most \nimportantly Damon Hill (a content­\ned Dublin resident for the last few \nyears) would for once be able to \nwalk out his front door and catch \nthe Dart to work. \nAnd that leads us rather nicely to \nmy last point. Unlike Hungary \nwhere the whole show sets itself \nup every damned blasted Summer , \nwe here in Ireland have a major \ninterest in the workings of Grand \nPrix racing. Eddie Jordan, a native \nof leinster, owns and runs one of \nthe top five teams. E. Irvine \n(Northern Ireland) drives the sec­\nond Ferrari, a Celt called Walton is \nteam manager over at Arrows and \nquite recently Mayo born Martin \nBirrane, a former Nascar team \nowner, bought Lola Cars Ltd who \nproduce the machines for F3000, \nthe next step down from F1 and \nthe place from which many of the \nfuture Grand Prix stars will \nemerge. I could continue, but that \nwould be to labour the point. \nEssentially he \naps of us Irish work in and around \nFormula One , clearly justifying the \nestablishment of our very own race \nover here. Its in our blood and \nwe're in its veins. \nSo that's my proposal, a race for \nthe new millennium. I wish I had \nthe pull, power or whatever it is \n(money probably) to get the ball \nrolling, but I don't. My only real \nconsolation, and it should be yours \ntoo, is that if I am able to see the \nsense in this then surely Misters \nJordan, Irvine, Birrane and the rest \nare also. If so, then maybe they'll \nkick-start the project themselves. If \nnot then I'll just have to make it \nrich real quick, marry Bernie \nEcclestone's daughter (the guy \nwho pulls all the sport's strings) \nand bring the show here myself. \nNot a bad idea.

In this issue's \nwe will attempt to save your souls and spice up your \nsex life (not at the same time however). \nAustralians it seems are this week trying to become a \nbit more cultural and romantic. Having heard that the \nFrench are romantic it appears that a certain French \ncustom is now been tried out in the bedrooms down \nunder. The French custom in question is not snail eat­\ning or boles -but the act of Menage -a-trios more com­\nmonly known as a threesome. \nSex Life the premiere Australian journal on relation­\nships and sex has in its latest issue published guide­\nlines on the best way to go about having a threesome \nand keeping your relationship in tact if that's possible!! \nWhile it gives helpful suggestions on how to recruit the \nextra person to join you and your partner for the three­\nsome it doesn't suggest how you might bring up the \nidea to your partner -like do you just kind of say \"dar­\nling I was wondering maybe the next time we make \nlove that perhaps we could bring a friend of yours to \nbed with us!!\" I don't reckon it could happen as easily \nas that for most couples without a huge argument and \nvarious claims of infidelity amongst other things!! \n(speak for yourself ... -Ed) The journal brings readers \nthrough every aspect of the act saying what to do if \nyou get cold feet at the last minute and want to pull \nout of the threesome (no pun intended!) or how to \nreact the next morning when you wake up the next \nmorning and find someone else in the bed with your­\nself and your partner -or what to say if you kids walk \nin the next morning \" its okay kids we were just hav­\ning a slumber party but don't tell granny!!\". \nA major concern the journal has that everything is dis­\ncussed the next morning over breakfast • \"darling can \nyou pass the tea oh and by the way did you enjoy \nSave our \nAddict \nThe Priests are tak­\ning to the highways \nin an effort to save our \nsouls the information \nHighway that is.

They could have Dishy Disciple of the \nmonth and god knows how they would treat the book \nof revelations!!

      "raw_text": "FOUR WHEELS AND A WIND \nTUNNEL -an F1 column from \nour point of view! \nLatest Drop recruit, Formula \nOne mad Hoss Carney, argues \npersuasively on behalf of an Irish \nGrand Prix .. Can you stretch your \nimagination for a moment? I mean \nreally stretch it? If so would you \nplease conjure up the image of 22 \nFormula one racing cars which \nbetween them , incidentally, pump . \nout well over 16,000 Brake Horse \nPower -the equivalent of near \nenough 540 Nissan Mieras. Now \nplace them on their starting blocks \nand situate this loud little scene \njust short of a start line painted \nacross the upper stretch of our \nvery own William St. The lights go \ngreen, Nora Bennis screams and \nDamon Hill makes a dive down the \ninside of Messer Schumacher to \ncleanly come out leading the inau­\ngural Irish Grand Prix which hap­\npens to be taking place right here \non the streets of Limerick. \nAm I mad to even suggest such a \nthing? The answer, believe it or \nnot, is that the possibility of our \ntiny island hosting a Grand Prix \nsometime in the new century isn't \nas far fetched as it may seem . \nMind you in the broader daylight of \ncommon sense Limerick itself \nmightn't be in their with a shout but \nsurely Cork, Dublin or Belfast \ncould satisfy all the financial, logis­\ntic and safety demands which the \nF.I.A. (the world motor sports gov­\nerning body) would place on such \na high profile event. Dublin at least \ncould cope with the influx of sports \nfans for the weekend; creating a \nsuitable race track wouldn't be \nbeyond our means either -\nMondello might be modified or \nsome suitable streets could be cor­\ndoned off to establish a temporary \ncircuit (as they do in Monaco and \nMelbourne); corporate sponsorship \nfor the show, an essential ingredi­\nent these days, couldn't be too \nhard to come by now that the \nCeltic tiger is in full swing; and I'm \nquite sure the government would \ngladly accept the odd £1 ,000,000 \ndonation in order to forgo any talk \nof disallowing tobacco advertising -\nthey say it worked with the Blair \nadministration across the water so \nwhy not here? All the other minor \nobstacles -arranging booking \nagents, planning permission, secu­\nrity, local promotion, travel agents, \netc ... -which might halt proceed­\nings if they weren't taken care of \nproperly could be dealt with by a \ndedicated committee of Irish Grand \nPrix organisers. Ergo, in theory \nthere's no reason why it couldn't \nbe done. \nThe benefits Ireland would accrue \nfrom hosting a round of the World \nChampionship would be phenome­\nnal. Money would be pumped into \nthe economy by all those race \ngoers intent on spending every last \ncent of their hard earned dosh in \nour pubs, clubs, restaurants and \nhotels. Our international profile \nwould get a healthy boost by being \non the bill of the largest TV sport in \nthe world. We here at home would \nbe able to see, hear and breathe in \nthe atmosphere of a fully fledged \nF1 weekend without having to \ncatch a ferry, take a flight or con­\nvert our entire life savings into \nDollars or Deutchmarks. And most \nimportantly Damon Hill (a content­\ned Dublin resident for the last few \nyears) would for once be able to \nwalk out his front door and catch \nthe Dart to work. \nAnd that leads us rather nicely to \nmy last point. Unlike Hungary \nwhere the whole show sets itself \nup every damned blasted Summer , \nwe here in Ireland have a major \ninterest in the workings of Grand \nPrix racing. Eddie Jordan, a native \nof leinster, owns and runs one of \nthe top five teams. E. Irvine \n(Northern Ireland) drives the sec­\nond Ferrari, a Celt called Walton is \nteam manager over at Arrows and \nquite recently Mayo born Martin \nBirrane, a former Nascar team \nowner, bought Lola Cars Ltd who \nproduce the machines for F3000, \nthe next step down from F1 and \nthe place from which many of the \nfuture Grand Prix stars will \nemerge. I could continue, but that \nwould be to labour the point. \nEssentially he \naps of us Irish work in and around \nFormula One , clearly justifying the \nestablishment of our very own race \nover here. Its in our blood and \nwe're in its veins. \nSo that's my proposal, a race for \nthe new millennium. I wish I had \nthe pull, power or whatever it is \n(money probably) to get the ball \nrolling, but I don't. My only real \nconsolation, and it should be yours \ntoo, is that if I am able to see the \nsense in this then surely Misters \nJordan, Irvine, Birrane and the rest \nare also. If so, then maybe they'll \nkick-start the project themselves. If \nnot then I'll just have to make it \nrich real quick, marry Bernie \nEcclestone's daughter (the guy \nwho pulls all the sport's strings) \nand bring the show here myself. \nNot a bad idea. Not a bad idea at \nall!",

In those days ev~one carried his snuff-box, \nand after a salutation ancf!!'li shake bands the snuff-box \nwas at once produced, and a pinch on either side was \ntaken. Now-a-days only very old-fashioned people, and \nthe clergy who ,do not smoke .are the only consumers of, \n: the .. ar.ticle. \n,W:hat efforts the.Agricultural:D:epartment have made ·. \nto revive this once, flourishing, industry, ,or rather w~at . \n, mistakes .ancl blunders they have perpetratd, despite \nthe privileges won and the bounty obtained for them \nby the Irish members of the House of Commons, I \nshall deal with in a succeeding article. R. H. 0. \nW AN1'E,D-50i IRISH SPINNING WHEELS ·. \nThe principal of an Engineering.and Machine Making \n-Firm of London, writing to a cousin of his in Dublin un­\nder datq 17th April, says:-\":( have before me a somewhat \n11eculiar enquiry from Central Africa. As you are well \naw are, there is a great deal of wool spun by hand in \nIreland, and the spinners use a 'spinning wheel' as it_ \nis called, worked by hand or by foot; the enquiry f \nhave received is for 50 such spinning wheels. A firm \nwants to import them, and to set the natives to spin \nwool, goats' hair and cotton. I have no doubt that \nthere are in Ireland two or three makers of these spin­\nning wheels, and I shall feel exceedingly obliged if you \nwould endeavour to find out the names of the makers, \nso as to enable me to place an order for 50 of the \n~achines. I expect they are made · by joiners or similar \npeople in a small way, still, it is quite possible that \none man may µave distinguished himself above others· \nin making good wheels, . and might have a reputation \nfor them.\" The recipient of this letter called to the· \nLEADER Office. We trust that the extract we have \ngiven will meet the eyes of those capable of executing \nthis order for Central Africa. Vve shall be glad to \nforward any replies to the proper quarter. \n-11'\"-!!_ke ·MURRAY'S MELLOW MIXT ·U·RE \n~ FOR OYER 50 YEARS THE \n~1 ~ ...-National Smoking Mixture \nA PUBLIC MEETING \nWill be held on \nSUNDAY, 30-th APRIL, \nIn the Christian Brothers' Schools, .North Brunswick .

Last week our readers will recollect Messrs. S. \nIrwin and Son, Paper Manufacturers; the firm of Rath­\nborne elating back to 1488, Oandle Manufacturers; \nMessrs. M. Mahony Hros., Ltd., Blarney, Cloth Manu­\nfacturers; M \"ossrs. Ji~mes Watson and Co., Stained \nGlass Makers and Church Decorators of Youghal; Mr. \nJ. A. O'Connell, A.rt Marble Works, Cork; The Oity of \nGalway Woollen Manufacturing Co ., Ltd.; Galway, and \nthe Lee Boot Manufacturing Co., Cork, stated their \nviews, and one and all, of course, agreed with the views \nso frequently and forcibly set forth in the LEADER. \nThis· week we print the \".iews of the great Wexford \nAgricultural Implement and Bicycle Firm, Messrs . \nPhilip Pierce and Oo. ; of Messrs. W. Dennehy and \nSons, the enterprising and expanding Hat Manufactui·­\ning Firm; Messrs. P. J. Carroll arid Co., Tobacco \nManufacturers, of Dunclalk; Messrs. John McDonnel \nand Co ., Ltd., the Paper Makers of Saggart, Co . \nDublin; Messrs. E. Ryan and Co., Ltd., Soap Manu­\nfacturers, Cork; Messrs. ·James O'Mara and Son, Bacon \nFactory, Limerick, and Messrs. F . ·Smyth and Soil, \nUmbrella Manufactu 'rers, 75 Grafton Street, Dublin. \nOur readers will no doubt be struck by the sturdy \nand independent tone of all the letters. Messrs. Philip \nPierce and Co ., who have found a market for theii· \nmachinery and bicycles in face of the world's-competi­\ntion, ought to know what they are talking about; how­\never, we suppose the few sentimentalists who, with the \nbest intentions in the world, no doubt, have been doing \ngreat injury to Irish manufactui·e by their foolish. talk \nabout spoon-feeding Irish manufactmers at the expense \nof purchasers-we suppose these sentimentalists know \na great deal more about the matter than Philip Pierce \nand Co., of Wexford! • It -will be noticed that Messrs. \nvV. Dennehy and Sons, of Cork, expressly state \"Now, \nwe think, that Irish m anufacturers should protest \nagainst this view, which, in our experience, is doing a \ngreat deal of harm.\" Messrs. James O'lVfara and Son, \nof Limerick, remark that they sell 75 per cent. oJ \ntheir products in the English, Continental, and Colonial \nmarkets. That fact, as they point out, indicates a \nstate of apathy in the support of Irish goods in the \nhome market. It is obvious to any shrewd man that \nthis absurd sentimental cry of giving more for things \nbecause they are Irish, plays into the enemies' h!!,nds, \nand helps to defeat the purpose of a business-like 'indus­\ntrial revival by creating au impression that the supporj:, \nof frish goods is to be accompanied by a financial sacri­\nfice on the part of the pmchaser . It would be to the \ninterest of British manufacturers who are being hit m \nthe Irish market by the increasing support given to \nIrish goods that this absurd-a.ad thoughtless proposition \nshould be popularised. Next week we will publish ' . \nanother ba,tch of manufa._cturers' opinions. • \nMes~rs. Philip Pierce ,incl C'o., Agricultural Ma.chiner); \nand Cycle Manufacturers, of Wexford, write: -\n\" DEAR Sm,-In reply to the qu-z!'tions a.sked in your \nCircular-letter, of the 15th inst.

Now, in the w:hole of Ireland \nthere ~re less than twenty. . \nIt will t½us be seen what a decadence there is during \nthe last thirty years; and how this once flourishing in­\ndus~ry has gradually been contracting and diminishing \nuntil we may a.lmost say 1',he principal business of this \ntrade is now practically in the hands of some haH­\ndozeu manufacturer!!. \nDown to t.he last ten or fifteen years, the Irish manu­\nfacturing tobacco trade held its own in the \"roll and \npressed toba.ccos.\" In fact a.ll over Scotland' and Eng­\nla11d \"Irish Roll,\" and \"Irish Pigtail,\" and \"Plug \" \nwa.s to be found, and in America and the Colonies even \n\"Irish Roll \" and \" Na.il Roel \" had its market. Snuff, \ntoo, (Irish snuff) had a great vogue in the early part of \nthe last century. \" Lundyfo ot \" and \" Irish Brown,\" \n,and \"Irish Toast,\" snuffs were· known world wide, and \nmost pro:fita.ble articles they were to the makers. \nFashion, however, has changed, and now snuff taking \nhas almost gone out, and what is made in Ireland is \nchiefly exported. \" Snuff\" at wakes and social parties \nin the thirties to the sixties and down to the eighties \nwas popular, and as largely consumed as whiskey or \nwine. In those days ev~one carried his snuff-box, \nand after a salutation ancf!!'li shake bands the snuff-box \nwas at once produced, and a pinch on either side was \ntaken. Now-a-days only very old-fashioned people, and \nthe clergy who ,do not smoke .are the only consumers of, \n: the .. ar.ticle. \n,W:hat efforts the.Agricultural:D:epartment have made ·. \nto revive this once, flourishing, industry, ,or rather w~at . \n, mistakes .ancl blunders they have perpetratd, despite \nthe privileges won and the bounty obtained for them \nby the Irish members of the House of Commons, I \nshall deal with in a succeeding article.

As you are well \naw are, there is a great deal of wool spun by hand in \nIreland, and the spinners use a 'spinning wheel' as it_ \nis called, worked by hand or by foot; the enquiry f \nhave received is for 50 such spinning wheels. A firm \nwants to import them, and to set the natives to spin \nwool, goats' hair and cotton. I have no doubt that \nthere are in Ireland two or three makers of these spin­\nning wheels, and I shall feel exceedingly obliged if you \nwould endeavour to find out the names of the makers, \nso as to enable me to place an order for 50 of the \n~achines. I expect they are made · by joiners or similar \npeople in a small way, still, it is quite possible that \none man may µave distinguished himself above others· \nin making good wheels, . and might have a reputation \nfor them.\" The recipient of this letter called to the· \nLEADER Office.

Th e Friday M arket is open from 11.00am and now \ncomp liments the existing Saturday Marke t where , as well \nas crafts, the emph asis lies wi th fruit and veg, horticul­\nture, cut flowers, cheeses, poultry, preserves, country but­\nter and m uch m ore d:,licious home-produ ced fare. \nEDGE \nTHE ALTERNATIVE CLOTHING COMPANY \n59 CATHERINE STREET & THE MILK MARKET \nORIGINAL LEVI'S M ADE IN U .S.A \nBLUE JEANS .

T he \nname was bestowed in 1852 and like so m any other things \ngoo d o r bad, has since stuck.

A nd it \nis actually on M ungret Street that you are able to view the \nrestored Ma rket Ho use, a mo st w orthy project. \nT he shops facing the street have alread y proved to be \nextrem ely popular wi th local and visiting shoppers alike, \nwi th The Vintage, Greenac res, Mulqu eens, The Edge, \nThe Black Marble B istro and Caf e plus La zios R estau­\nrant and T ake Awa y whi ch is open every night.

Th e Friday M arket is open from 11.00am and now \ncomp liments the existing Saturday Marke t where , as well \nas crafts, the emph asis lies wi th fruit and veg, horticul­\nture, cut flowers, cheeses, poultry, preserves, country but­\nter and m uch m ore d:,licious home-produ ced fare. \nEDGE \nTHE ALTERNATIVE CLOTHING COMPANY \n59 CATHERINE STREET & THE MILK MARKET \nORIGINAL LEVI'S M ADE IN U .S.A \nBLUE JEANS .

T he \nname was bestowed in 1852 and like so m any other things \ngoo d o r bad, has since stuck.

That activity takes the shape of a much anticipated return to Limerick for the mighty Trevor \nRockliffe, whose March 16th appearance at the Gallery S years ago was one of the finest nights out \nLimerick has ever seen. \nTrevor Rockiiffe is a world renowned DJ and Producer of the highest calibre. There are few around \nwith his versatility and pure feel for the funk and he is regarded as a leading light by the likes of Carl \nCox, Slam and Laurent Gamier to name a few. His comb ination of pumping techno and floor-fliendly \ntech-house have made him one of funkiest techno dj's around! He works with the best (Samel L \nSessions, Daz Sound, Blake Baxter) and with multiple releases on labels such as Bush, Primitive, \nMoonshine, Tresor, he is likely to play some wicked tunes. \n• This is the man who, alongside Blake Baxter, produced the dassic ''Visions Of You\" on the now \ndefunct Ultimatum Trax. Recently re-released on Intec, some the world's finest electronic producers \nqueued up to remix it, leading to one of Intec's greatest successes to date. He also co-produced, \nalongside Christian Smith, a one off project Destination \"Definition Of Love\", one of Intec's early \npaul collins gets technical.. ..... \nHouse Music, Strive and of course Intec Records.

Trevor is now putting the finishing touches to a follow up EP that promises to take his sound .. --------------------• \na step further. \nDespite all the quality production however, his first love is djing. Back in the mid 80's it started off \nwith a love for collecting and listening to Soul, Jazz, Funk, Electro and Rare Groove records and soon \nbecame a hobby, playing at a small dub called Zigis in London. His influences indude Tom Brown, \nGrover Washington, Pleasure and Earth, W ind and Fire and this is reflected in the soulful touch he \nadds to his music. \nDjing eventually turned into a career for Trevor and he made his name with a residency at 'Troll' \ndub in London in the early 90's. From this point on there was no looking back and with a passion to \nentertain and educate, Trevor went on to gain Djing global notoriety that has taken him around the \nworld to the world's leading dubs such as Dorian Gray/ Tresor(Germany), Industry(Canada), \nTwilo(New York), Dance Valley(Holland), Fuse(Belgium), to the well known Festivals such as Love \nParade, Dance Planet, Tribal Gathering and Homelands. In 1998, after DJ spots in London clubs Trade \nand Garage, he became a resident at Ultimate Base, where he played alongside other residents Jim \nMasters and Carl Cox and such guests as Josh Wink, Darren Emerson and Laurent Gamier. \nTrevor has released over 20 high quality productions on labels like Mentor, Bush, Primevil, Dark \n+ mag I c trio \nlynne arriale trio I castle~roy par_k hate.I I march 27-:,~.

I wasn't expect- mcguire, takes a look at the riffs \ning a rock show from them because I heard before hand \nthat they had only been together five months but they \nsoon ripped apart my premature opinion with their catchy \nmelodies and confident stage presence. 'The Riffs' are \ncomprised of Alan O'Keefe (lead guitar), Tom O 'Keefe (vocals, guitar), \nBart Kelly (bass) and Denny Dunworth (drums). Yes you have guessed \ncorrectly, Alan and Tom are cousins and like to fight a lot so they tell \nme . \nIf you were lucky enough to attend that gig last month then you too \nwill be so surprised into believing that this band have only been \ntogether since last September. Their very first gig was in Costello's \nsupporting 'Atrophy' and truthfully the boys told me they sucked major \nass. But this downfall was taken in as experience and they continued \non supporting loads of other bands such as 'giveamanakick' in the \nHighstool. Both the O 'Keefe boys had worked in HMV before so they \n• got to know the AMC boys very well, which gave them the leg in the \ndoor of the Limerick music scene. \nLEG hangs with the new kids on the block ......... \nALAN: \"From myself and Tom 's point of view our major influence is Radiohead, \nhow can you go wrong with albums like 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer'.\" \nTOM: \"Yeah for me I think Thom Yorke has the most incredible unique voice in \nthe music industry\". \nLEG; \"Ahh sure I wouldn't go that far, you cant be cancelling out Eddie Vedder, \nsorry but I'm a big Pearl Jam fan and proud of it. \n'The Riffs' plan to play as many gigs as they can this year and are focused on \nmaking it big, this Isn't just a hobby for them but more of a living. They are \narranged to play with 'Jet Plane Landing' this coming May and are headlining \ntheir first gig up in the Savoy on the 27th of March. They have also handed in \ntheir demo into the IMRO team so they can get a shot at this years IMRO com· \npetition, and you can of course catch them in the Unviersity Concert Hall sup· \nporting Kittser on Thursday, April 03, so make sure you watch this space. At the moment they have released a three-track self-titled demo \nwith songs such as 'Bring It On' and 'Stay'. Fergal Nash recorded this \ndemo out in Kilcornan in a shed. The demo is kind of a poor recording \nbut the lads do admit that money was a problem at the time and still \nis, but they hope to change that very soon with a few gigs coming up. \nIf you want to get in contact with the band them email them at \n0270385@student .ul.ie.

That activity takes the shape of a much anticipated return to Limerick for the mighty Trevor \nRockliffe, whose March 16th appearance at the Gallery S years ago was one of the finest nights out \nLimerick has ever seen. \nTrevor Rockiiffe is a world renowned DJ and Producer of the highest calibre. There are few around \nwith his versatility and pure feel for the funk and he is regarded as a leading light by the likes of Carl \nCox, Slam and Laurent Gamier to name a few. His comb ination of pumping techno and floor-fliendly \ntech-house have made him one of funkiest techno dj's around! He works with the best (Samel L \nSessions, Daz Sound, Blake Baxter) and with multiple releases on labels such as Bush, Primitive, \nMoonshine, Tresor, he is likely to play some wicked tunes. \n• This is the man who, alongside Blake Baxter, produced the dassic ''Visions Of You\" on the now \ndefunct Ultimatum Trax. Recently re-released on Intec, some the world's finest electronic producers \nqueued up to remix it, leading to one of Intec's greatest successes to date.

Trevor is now putting the finishing touches to a follow up EP that promises to take his sound .. --------------------• \na step further. \nDespite all the quality production however, his first love is djing. Back in the mid 80's it started off \nwith a love for collecting and listening to Soul, Jazz, Funk, Electro and Rare Groove records and soon \nbecame a hobby, playing at a small dub called Zigis in London. His influences indude Tom Brown, \nGrover Washington, Pleasure and Earth, W ind and Fire and this is reflected in the soulful touch he \nadds to his music. \nDjing eventually turned into a career for Trevor and he made his name with a residency at 'Troll' \ndub in London in the early 90's. From this point on there was no looking back and with a passion to \nentertain and educate, Trevor went on to gain Djing global notoriety that has taken him around the \nworld to the world's leading dubs such as Dorian Gray/ Tresor(Germany), Industry(Canada), \nTwilo(New York), Dance Valley(Holland), Fuse(Belgium), to the well known Festivals such as Love \nParade, Dance Planet, Tribal Gathering and Homelands. In 1998, after DJ spots in London clubs Trade \nand Garage, he became a resident at Ultimate Base, where he played alongside other residents Jim \nMasters and Carl Cox and such guests as Josh Wink, Darren Emerson and Laurent Gamier. \nTrevor has released over 20 high quality productions on labels like Mentor, Bush, Primevil, Dark \n+ mag I c trio \nlynne arriale trio I castle~roy par_k hate.I I march 27-:,~.

A lyrical improviser in the mould of Bill Evans, her talent for reharmonization and \ndriving, rhythmic approach bring an exhilarating sense of adventure to the unlikeliest of \ntunes. The Lynne Arriale Trio tour will feature new Arrlale compos itions and tracks from \nher chart-topping CD 'Inspiration'. \nNew York pianist, Lynne Arriale began her musical studies at age four and eventually \nearned a master's degree in piano performance from the Wisconsin Conservatory of \nMusic. Her career path took a sudden turn when she decided to pursue a career as a jazz \npianist, committed to developing her own sound as a leader, composer, and arranger (in \nthe tradition of Keith Jarrett and Bill Evans). Since that time, she has performed through­\nout the world· with her trio. In the past year, the Lynne Arri ale Trio has played concerts \nand festivals in Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Italy, England, Ireland, \nand Scotland as well as numerous tours throughout the U.S. and Canada. She was the \nwinner of the 1993 International Great American Jazz Competition in Jacksonville, \nFlorida, and has performed in concert and on National Public Radio's Plano Jazz with jazz \nlegend Marian McPartiand. She's also toured Japan as part of the prestigious 100 Golden \nFingers group, with jazz greats Hank Jones, Tommy Flanagan, Kenny Barron, Harold \nMabern, Junior Mance, Monty Alexander, Roger Kellaway, Ray Bryant and Cedar Walton. \nBassist/composer Jay Anderson began playing acoustic bass at the age of 12. Since \nthat time, he has won numerous awards for both jazz and classical performance. Jay Is a \ngraduate of Callfornia State University at Long Beach . Since moving to New York City In \n1982, he has continued to perform and record with some of the most Important names \nIn jazz, and has been a regular member in the bands of Red Rodney & Ira Sullivan, \nMichael Brecker, Toots Thielemans, Michael Franks, Ellane Elias, Bennie Wallace, Steve \nKhan, Carmen McRae and has b,~en a regular with \nthe great Joe Sample since 199:!. \nDrummer Steve Davis has p~rformed with David \nLiebman, Bill Evans, Richie Bierach, John \nPattitucci, Pat LaBarbara and Walt Weiskopf, and \nhas over seventy recordings to his credit.

          "text": "+ \n-\nthe 4 of us I the warehouse I mar 21 \n\"Don't apologise for what you are or do\" explains Brendan Murphy on \nHeaven and Earth, the latest album from The 4 of Us. The Newry \nband fronted by Murphy have inadvertently etched a new path away \nfrom the pop fuelled days of 'She Hits Me' and 'Mary'. You sense from \nMurphy's casual yet confident remarks about the album, that little \ncan knock them from a pedestal they haven't created. \"The album \njust happened ... We were in a better place for this album ... it was the \nmost fun to make\". The 4 of Us let maturity ease the choking reality \nof the mus ic business and all that a new album brings. \n'Heaven and Earth' has been receiving positive reviews since its \nrelease on Valentine's Day last. A charming unassum ing comp ilation, \nat times closer to acoustic singer songw riter genres than the former \ncatchy sways of 'Oh Mary'. While 1999's \"Classified Personal\" may \nhave been noted at times for its nonchalant mellowness, it never \ncommitted in the way the latest endeavour does with easy m elody \nand carefree crevasses. \n'Heaven and Earth' contrasts greatly with 'Songs For The Tempted' \nwhich was released remarkably 14 years ago. \"With 'Songs For The \nTempted' we were young in the recording studio\" explained Murphy. \nTheir boyish excitement flows out regardless with an effervescence of \nupfront pop and party energy on the album . \n\"With 'Man Alive', we just wanted rock and roll\", Brendan contin­\nued, \"while 'Classified Personal' was really about coming to terms \nwith being in your 30's and more confused than ever!\" \nHotpress's Oliver Sweeney asked why the band weren't world-beat­\ners after hearing \"Off the Record\". The reality was as much the \nband's fault as the public's. To become world-beaters takes effort and \nBrendan Murphy isn't too enthused about travelling around for \nmonths on end, treading the never-ending bridges of producing, pro­\nmoting and performing. \"Sunlight\", the first single from Heaven and \nEarth, may be more notable here for its fantastic B-side cover of \n\"Blackbird\" which accompanied the release, but stateside it was \nselected as the theme to the popular HBO show 'The M ind Of The \nMarried Man'. \nWhen I asked Brendan about pursuing its success with an injection \nof promotional work there, he dismissed with a resigned \"I don't envy \nbeing stuck in the back of a bus for 3 months\". However, the short \ntour of Ireland taking Jn the usual popular venues such as Vicar St. \nas well as_ our own Dolan's Warehouse he describes as \"Brilliant\". \nAfter the single release last October, The 4 of Us visited Dolan's and \noffered a preview into some of the new tracks live. Here the latest \n4 non blondes \nlike so many \nother i rish bands, \nthe 4 of \nU S have conti n­\nued to make \nrecords without \nmajor support or \nsuccess. they're \nback with a new \none and an \nupcoming gig \ntommy finneran \ntalks numbers ..... . \nshift became evident. While \"Sunlight\" is definitely a cosy FM cre­\nation, its others like the intimate \"Gospel Choir\" with Brendan's \nnorthern tinged voice asking 'Can I start by saying, I'm not sure \nthere's a God .. .' that are the new gems. \nOld faithfuls ensure that any 4 of Us gig is a definite delight, but \nthe unhurried character of the Heaven and Earth influence should \nadd a ripeness and self-assurance, that those eager youngsters Ill \nwho exploded with promise back in the eighties, could never deliv- • \ner. \ntomas finneran \n9 Sarsfield Street~ limerick \nTel: 061 410851 \nfax: 061 ·410831 \nEntertainment \nwednesday 12 \nthursday 13 \nfriday 14 \nsaturday 15 \nsunday 16 \nwednesday 19 \nthursday 20 \nfriday 21 \nSaturday 22 \nsunday 23 \nNoel Mcloughlin \nThe Waxies \nResident DJ \nResident DJ \nLive Music \nNoel Mcloughlin \nShantytown \nResident DJ \nResident DJ \nAtomic Chicken \nWHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IS ALWAYS ON TAP",

Frontman John \nSchmersal was once guitarist with Braniac, a band who were consid- , \nered by many to be one of the most promising independent acts in \n-America at the time. However, tragedy intervened when Braniac s \nfrontman Tim Taylor was killed in a car crash in 1997. Following Taylor \ns death, Schmersai drifted for a while, briefly trading under the solo \nalias of John Stuart Mill. After one record ( Forget Everything ), he \n•reverted back to his old name, and set about forming a new group. \nThis new outfit, Enon, released their debut LP, Believo! in 2000. \nSomewhere between then and the release of current album High \n,society , which was released last summer, original members Rick Lee \n·and Steve Calhoon left the band. Drummer Matt Schulz, and \n,bassist/sometimes vocalist Toko Yasuda (formerly of Blonde Redhead \n,and The Lapse) currently augment Schmersal s ranks. \nIf High Society is anything to go by, Enon are one of the bands that \n1are rather difficult to pigeonhole. Sure, they are an indie act, yet \n'there is a whole lot more going on. Samples and moments of elec-\n1tronica regularly play as much a part in this record as guitars. \n!\nHowever, at the core of the album, there seems to be a pop sensibility, \nin the delivering of the tunes. Opening track Old. Dominion seems to \n1 \ntip It s hat In the direction of Pavement and the likes. Indeed, fans of i \n1stephen Malkmus old crew would be suitably impressed with tracks • \nflike Window Display , with it s somewhat quirky lyrics and harmonious \n[guitar-driven choruses. Perhaps the finest lyrics on the record can be 1\nfound on the track Carbonation , which ·sounds something like what \nBeck was up to circa Mldnite Vultures . Schmersal and Yasuda pro­\nclaim In the chorus that This business carbonation/less pop, more \nfizz/come along on another radio station/It s kllllng us kids . \nIndeed, most of the tracks featuring Yasuda on lead vocals tend to \nlean towards the more electronic side. It seems to be something of a \nparadox that her somewhat sugary, gentle vocals are usually perfectly \n.supported by the weirder noises on the record. Take for example, \nDisposable Parts , where Schmersal s chips In with some strange \n•vocoder sounds, or Salty , which opens with bleeps and beats, before \n!\nturning Into a guitar workout, sounding something like Shellac, and \nbeing covered with a big chorus.-Throw Into the mix a few tracks like \n!shoulder , which owe a bit to new wave and songs like the garagey \nPain and Pleasure , and as I mentioned earlier; It Is near Impossible to \n1plgeonhole High Society I \nAll In all, It makes for yet another Interesting date In the Aspersion \nMusic Collective s busy calendar. Support on the night comes from \nicork's Waiting Room, who apparently feature members from the won­\niderful Weevil. The price on the door will, as always, be very, very rea­\nsonable. \nFor more Information on forthcoming AMC shows, go to \n1www.theamc.net. \nFor more Information on Enon, go to www.enon.tv.",

Byrne, Kitson, Tiernan \netc throughout February they are now looking to showcase the \nbest of Irish. March 12th sees the appearance of David 0 \nDoherty a former w inner of the Channel 4 ? So You Think Your \nfunny? new comedy award at Ed inburgh. March 19th sees the \nIrrepressible Davy McSavage, fresh from touring with the likes of \nTommy Tiernan & Ph il Kay, Davy Is a pretty spectacular show, a \nspecial combination of abuse and laughs It shouldn?t be missed. \nHe Is also known for his public displays of nudity and his father \nwho is a former M inister for Foreign Affairs but that?s another \nstory altogether and with any luck he might keep his clothes on \nat the gig, or maybe he won?t. But the highlight for March is \nbound to be Mr Des Bishop. Des Is a big draw any time he plays \nin Limerick, his blend of rants, raps and introspective moments \nof chatting with a rapt audience go down a treat. His show Is a \nreal roller coaster ride, he really enthuses about his material, \nthere's no deadpan here! \nDes is one of Ireland?s favourite comed ians despite actually \nbeing from New York. After spending his teens in Cork, Des \nquickly made a name for himself on the Irish comedy circuit and \nnow headlines all the major clubs around the country. He also \nruns, and hosts, one of Dublin's most popular weekly comedy \nvenues at the International Bar. \nWell Known for his time as team captain on RTE 's Don 't Feed the \nGondola's, other TV credits include the Emp ire Laughs Back (BBC \n2), The Lounge (The Irish version of The BBC's Stand Up Show) \nand, quite a legendary experience, when he snuck into t_he \nEuropean MTV Music Awards in Dublin for At Last TV. This year \nDes scored his first role in a feature film in Jim Sheridan's East of \nHarlem, and he has become a familiar voice on radio as a regular \nguest presenter of both 98 FMs The After Dark show and The \nTalk of Dublin with Niall Boylan. \nDes appeared at the 1999 & 2000 Edinburgh Festivals, firstly as \npart of the heralded Cream of Irish, followed by the hip hop ~om­\nedy show, The Main Event. That same year he also tackled hrs \nhomeland by appearing at the famous Caroline's Comedy Club_ on \nBroadway in New York City. Since then Des has been mostly gig­\nging around Europe and t_he UK wh ich has seen his comedy style \nprogress from the ex patriot poet-laureate-hip-hop-comedy, to a \nmore aggressively observational look at this crazy world we live \n2002 was a busy year for Des. Last February, he was invited to \nperform at various venues around New York (and Boston) for the \nannual N.Y. Irish Comedy Festival wh ich was such a success, he \nwas invited back that May for another run of shows. Prior to that \nhe performed at a number of festivals in Northern_ Ireland, \nincluding dates w ith Owen O'Neill, then in August rt he headed to \nNiall started playing in the basement of McKnights over \ntwelve tears ago. It was small, dark and over packed. \nRecalling the atmosphere is best left to the man himself \n\"Within half an hour of it opening the sweat ran down the \nwalls of the club. Everyone in the place was nuts. It was \nmessy, unforgettable and hard to match\". \nEdinburgh for his debut solo fringe show, \"Com ical Warfare\".The show \nwas a huge success and boosted his profile considerably on the UK \nscene and generated a whole new fan base for the likable New Yorker. \n2003 has started in a similar manner the International his club in Dublin \ngoes from strength to strength and has established itself as the premier \nclub in Dublin. He is in unprecedented demand around the country , \ndrawing full houses wherever he goes and is all set for another assault \non Ed inburgh this summer . Des is at the Dot Comedy Club in Dolans \non Wednesday 26th March . Don?t miss him!!!!!!! \nFrom there he moved on to the infamous Theatre Royal \nwhere he played with Alex Handley, Trevor Rockliffe,. \nCharlie Hall among others. \"I remember finishing a set and \nAlex Handley came on to play four decks. That guy Is tal­\nented\", Around this time he played quite a lot of crusty \nparties to 2,000 - 3,000 people. \ndubbers because they let you know they're enjoyil}g themselves. It is \nhis favourite place to play. \"It might sound daft, as most people seem \nto bad mouth Limerick the whole time but having played some of the \nbiggest venues In the country I love playing in this town.\" \nFollowing a gig with Funk de Void (which he rates as one of \nthe most enjoyable gigs he has played) he was asked to \nplay in The Kitchen supporting Sven Vath.

          "text": "I \n-+ hip hop heroes \nrodney p & dj mek I high stool I mar 15 \nTwo veterans of the hip hop game come to Limerick's High Stool for what \nshould make It a very special Paddy's weekend for all local hip hop enthusi­\nasts. Quality hip hop is scarce to be heard In city centre venues but with \nthe excellent Dalek gig last December and more recently the Dynamo \nProductions DJ master class at Tuna, all things hip hop seem to be on the \nup. If reputations are anything to by, a night of classic beats and rhymes Is \nto be anticipated. \nUp first, DJ Mek, \"the undisputed king of Irish hip hop\". A title hard to \nargue with, Mek has won no less than five Irish DMC championships and \nhas mixed and scratched alongside the best hip hop djs In the world at the \nDMC world finals. Celbridge born Mek has been a cult figure on the Dublin \nhip hop scene for a number of years, making his name performing with \nScary Eire, a pioneering Dublin hip hop group of the early 90's. Alongside \nDJ Dada Sloosh and rappers Ri Ra and Mr. Browne, Mek formed an impor­\ntant part of the Dublin rap crew who gained particular attention for their \nuncompromising, punk like approach to their live shows . \nThe group were signed to Island Records and released Impressive hip hop \nsuch as the classic 'Dole Q' and 'Truncheon Song' which showcased the \ngroups mix of infectious beats and socially aware lyrics delivered w ith great \nhumour. Despite critical acclaim from magazine~ such as Hip Hop \nConnection, the bible of British hip hop, and plenty of plaudit~ for their \nelectric live show, Scary Eire never managed to grab the success their \npotential seemed to promise. With Irish hip hop receiving more support \nnow than it ever has, the success and radio play received by groups such \nas Third Eye Surfers and Creative Controle being clear evidence, It seems \nScary Eire were a bit before their time. However Mek is keeping busy w ith \nrecent DJ sets amassing more and more praise for his radical approach \nwh ich takes his crowd an a musical journey interspersed by mind boggling \nvirtuoso exhibitions of his scratching skills. Along with his live shows, Mek is \nin the studio working on his solo album 'Mekanizmz ' which will featured \nsome incredible vocal talent from the legendary Rasta man Horace Andy to \nBobby Gillespie and ex members of Scary Eire. \nAlso due to appear on the Mek solo effort is Rodney P, the other main \nattraction of the night. The circumstances of Rodney P's career bears defi­\nnite similarities to that of Mek, both veterans of their respective hip hop \nscenes and both enjoying a sort of rebirth through the rise of home grown \nhip hop. As one half of the London Posse, the talented MC gained a global \nreputation through early 90's releases such as 'Money Mad' and 'Hows Life \nin London'. British hip hop at the time was not supported without being \nAmericanised in some way but the late 90's has seen an explosion of British \nhip hop talent aware of their roots and surroundings, with names such as \nRoots Manuva and Ms. Dynamite springing to mind \nEver since London Posse disbanded around 1996, Rodney P has been \nworking on solo material with much accomplishment. He began working \nwith producer Dobie releasing the reggae Influenced 'Luv and Hate' on the \nPussyfoot label which became one of the labels fastest selling records. His \n'Tings in Time' EP was later nominated for a prestigious MOBO award. \nniall bourke's \ncurrent top 10 \nclassic utilities various artists \nspleen attitude antony \nbitches from hell (rmx) various \n99.9 keonig Cyliners \nunknown secret cinema \nthe closer you come justin berkovi (rush rmx) \nf1cken thomas schumacher \nloud boxer speedy J \nhard to find it doesn't exist \nutilities \ngood life \ncorb \nexact audio \nunknown \nmusic man \ntfx \nmute \ngotcha \nrodney p I dj mek \nafter a fairly lengthy break, limerick's much \nmissed cheebah promotions are back with a \nshow for the london posse's r O d n e Y \np. with support from five time irish dmc \nchamp, d j me k, you don't want to \nmiss this night. trust us \neoin o'riordan checks his p's & q's ....... \nRodney has since worked with the leading lights of British rap such as \nRoots Manuva and Mark B & Blade and most notably producer Skitz. \nThe 'Countryman' LP by Skitz serves as an excellent introduction to \nthe growing British hip hop scene and Rodney P figures strongly on \nstandout tracks 'Dedication' and 'The Killing'. \nWith Rodney P working on his own solo album on his Riddim Killa \nRecords and Mek also at work in the studio and both going from \nstrength to strength, don't miss this rare opportunity to catch two of \nhip hops original players in action. \nt t e l!.

Mauro Picotto has \nalso delivered multi-selling compilation albums \nacross the globe, most notably the 60,000 selling \nMetamorphose techno comp ilation in Germany , \nan impressive figure as there was almost no mar­\nketing spend whatsoever, just word-of-mouth. \nMauro's debut artist album, \"The Others\", \nreleased on the March 04 of last year, is true to \nMauro's reputation as an uncomprom ising pro­\nducer. The album is banging from start to finish \nand is just what the doctor ordered! The vinyl \nalbum will be released in conjunction w ith the \nrelease of Mauro's next big anthem 'Back to Call' \nand includes two new tracks 'Global Mus ik' and \n'Were Back'. \nMauro's Djing schedule is crazy w ith him being \non more planes than the average pilot and play­\ning in front of the biggest crowds on this planet. \nMauro Is selective as to where he plays and per­\nforms at the best clubs and events in the world. \nThe tall end of last year handed him an especially \ngruelllng schedule, with regular guest spots In \nIbiza, a further world tour Incorporating North \nand South America, Asia, Malaysia, Australia and \nnearly every European country. \nAs an Internationally renowned D1 and produc­\ner, Picotte has done It all.

Thev alwavs sell out and I can exoeri­\nment more because of the 6 hour sets. On Feb 2nd I'm playing exclu­\nsively my new productions and re-mixes.\" \nWhy do you think you've been so successful in the UK & Ireland? • \n\"I'm not sure, but I think it's because I play a different style than most \nDJs.\" \nYou seem to be quite selective about where you play in the here, is that \ndeliberate? \n\"Yes, last year I played 97 gigs in the UK and this way I discovered the \nbest crow ds in the best clubs. Some clubs prefer trance mus ic so it's \nbest that I don't play there, other clubs have more open minded crowds \nw illing to be more experimental w ith the music they hear, these are the \nbest clubs.\" \nWh ere else in the world have you played recently? \n\"Japan, Hong Kong, Colombia, Malaysia, Croatia, USA and all over \nEurope. I am very happy where I play and consider myself very fortu­\nnate.\" \nHo w do the dance scenes in other countries compare to the UK & \nIreland? \n\"The people and clubs are very good but in the UK the politics is com­\nplete bullshit. I can understand why the best DJs in the world prefer to \nplay other countries. I guess the UK is a small market and everyone is \nfighting for their slice of the pie. South Amer ica and the U.S are the \nmost enthusiastic crow ds at the moment . I've just finished a 10 date \ntour there wh ich we did in February for the Carnival period which covers \nColomb ia, Venezuela, Peru, Me xico then M iam i, L.A and Vegas. \nHow popular is the dance scene in Italy? \n\"The Techno/ trance scene is smaller but house is still very popular.\" \nYou play quite a lot of 6 hour sets, do you prefer this to playing 2 and \nif so why? \n\"I prefer because I can play many different styles and experiment.\" \nHow many times do you go to the toilet during his marathon 6 hour \nsets? \n\"Haha! At least once but sometimes twice.\" \nWho do you admire most In the dance scene and for what reasons? \n\"I adm ire anyone that believes In their music and has the balls to stand \nup and be counted.\" \nAnd finally, what does the future hold for Mauro Picotto? \n\"Health for me and my family.\" \nSo there you have It, he's a bit of a quiet one our Mauro, to the point \nand no more.

His influences indude Tom Brown, \nGrover Washington, Pleasure and Earth, W ind and Fire and this is reflected in the soulful touch he \nadds to his music. \nDjing eventually turned into a career for Trevor and he made his name with a residency at 'Troll' \ndub in London in the early 90's. From this point on there was no looking back and with a passion to \nentertain and educate, Trevor went on to gain Djing global notoriety that has taken him around the \nworld to the world's leading dubs such as Dorian Gray/ Tresor(Germany), Industry(Canada), \nTwilo(New York), Dance Valley(Holland), Fuse(Belgium), to the well known Festivals such as Love \nParade, Dance Planet, Tribal Gathering and Homelands.

We see a mem-\n• her_ of the male p1;rsuasion, in full regimentals, seated \nbeside a table, havmg near his elbow on the said table a \nplumed hat, which would do well for L ord Kitchener in \nfull military regalia. The gentleman has a sword girded \non and ~1\\-S every 01,1tward sartorial sign of the soldier \nabout him . But perpend, reader: he is not a soldier. \nWhat then, say you 1 He was a mineral-water manu­\nfacturer.· What! Ay, a mineral-water manufacturer­\nin a Deputy-Lieutenant's uniform. Truly there is \nsomething about this portrait of the late Sir Henry Coch­\nrane which makes one smile. The homely, ordinary­\nlooking face, utterly unmilitary in aspect, and decorated \nwith a smile which looks like a furtive grin, fairly \nthrows one off one's balance, as one notes the egregiously \nhumorous ·contrast between the plain face and wooden \nbearing of the sitter, 11,nd his imposing displl!,y of mar­\ntial toggery. Nathaniel W _in.kle himself could not have \nlooked less like a soldier, and Sam Weller could not have \nleered with a more obvious consciousness of the incon­\ngruity of the situation. All this apart, the portrait \ndoes not seem well done; and will not go far tqwards \nputting Mr. S. Catterson Smith in front of Sargent. \nAmongst the Irish painters of portrait, _the only man \nwho seems to be advancing is Mr. Charles Russell. His \nportrait of the Duke of Richmond (No . 92) is one of the \nbest things he has done yet, and seems by, far the best \nbit of work in this ,qenre by ·any Irish artist in this \nyear's Exhibition. Another of Mr . Russell's portraits, \nColonel Vesey Davoren (No. 20), also shows advance, \nand seems to set the sitter off to advantage. \nThe best done portrait in the Academy, however, was \nnot by an Irish artist. Sir George Reid's portrait of \nthe Rev. Principal Hutton, D.D., is the most excellent­\npiece of work in the whole place. By comparison, Miss· \nPurser's \"Mrs. Charles O'Connor,\" which hangs right \nbeside Sir George Reid's work, looked quite weak and \nunreal. We have no man like Sir George Reid among \n··us ; that is plain. Mr. John Parker shows a fairly \ns.triking portrait o~ the late Edwin Hayes, R.H.A., our \ndistinguished Irish landscape painter. Mr . Hayes was • \na dignified-looking old· gentleman, of a venerable aspect. \nThe portrait of Cardinal Manning, by the late Edwin \nLong, R.A., has a depressing effect on the beholder, and \ndoes not look like the Cardinal. C'omte Casimer \nMarkiewicz paints a very ghostly portrait of Mrs . T. \nW. Russell, and ·a better one of Miss Pembert.on. By \nthe way, why do most ladies get their portraits painted \nin evening • dress 1 They wear pale colours, usually \nwhite, and so display a (genei·ally) pale countenance \nover a pale-coloured dress. I though colour upon colour \n·was \" bad heraldry \"-and not sound art? \nT-here are some frights in the portrait line exhibited, \nbut I shall not notice them; they are too bad to think \nabout.

A. M.W . \nTHE UNIVERSITY WITH THE GALVANIZED­\nIRON ROOF. \ni r HOSE of us who were at the meeting of the Catho-\nlic Graduates As sociation, at the Gresham Hotel, \non last Friday night, were no less-amazed than de­\nlighte~l to learn on the authority of lVIr. John Mac­\nNeill, B.A ., that the Gaelic League collects the stupen­\ndous sum of £20,000· per annum. The occasion of the \nmeeting was to start a fighting policy on the University \nQuestion ; and the plan of ca:mpaign propounded was \ntha~ the people of Ireland should put their hands :n \nthen· pockets and pay for the University Institute \nthemselves .. \nSome of the members , like the ·present writer, ex­\npressed th_emselves gre_atly dubious as to the possibility \nof extractrng voluutanly another £20-,000 from an over­\ntaxed people every year, but l\\fr. lVIacNeill darkly hinted \nthat the counsols of fear were the counsels of treachery \na·na as proof of the practicability of the proposal, stated \nthat the sum collected annually by the Gaelic League \nfor language purposes was £20,000. This cheering \nstatement was endorsed by Mr. Pearse, B.L., who ex­\nplained that the public collection was a mere fraction \nof the whole. It is intensely cheering to think that \nso ~ollossal a sum can be voluntarily raised in a poverty­\nst~·wken countr1, and from a people so sodden i.n \nmisery,_ bu_t still o~e doubts whethi:ir this amazing \ngenerosity 1s a suffi.crnnt ground for puttina a further \nlnu·den upon them. b . \nBy far the most i~portant and practicable suggestion \nwas put to the meetmg by Mr. J.

The man Coote, \nof Tyrone, a Justice of the Peace, has stimulated inter­\nest in the Orange Inquisition. It will be remembered that \neven .the Prote.stant incumbent of Clogher, Canon Hare­\n~o~ter, was dragged before this infamous Orange Inqui­\ns1t10n for unw orthy conduct as a Protestant and as· an \nOrangeman. vVe state the charge in the words quoted \nfrom the judgmenti delivered by Mi·. Justice Barton: -\n\" It appears that the defendant brought the Canon 's \nname before the lodge as having been guilty of un­\nworthy conduct as a Protestant minister and a member \nof th<'i lodge by aiding and abetting this Roman Catho­\nlic girl and usii}g his influence against the boycott of the \nschool.\" The Orange Inquisition of Ireland is cer­\ntainly not without interest to others besides the humble \nsewing instructress of Carntall \" non-sectarian\" Na­\ntional School. \nA village sing-song cannot be held in Ireland under \nany title less than a \" grand concert;\" there are any \namount of \" grand \" functionaries in the Oran,ge In­\nquisition; there are \" grand \" masters, \" grand \" chap­\nlains, \"grand\" secretary, \"deputy grand\" chaplains, \ncounty \" grand \" officers and \" grand \" committees. \nThe Rev. Bishop Stack, Clones; the Protestant Bishop \nof Ossory, Kilkenny; the Protestant Bishop of Derry \nand Raphoe are amongst the \" grand \" chaplains; the \nProtestant Bishop of Cashel, the notorious Dr. O'Hara, \nis one of the \" deputy grand \" chaplains. One Major \nA. vV-. Bailey, of the T.0.D. Lodge, is \"grand\" trea­\nsurer. \nAmongst the applications at a recent meeti11g of the \nGrand Orange Lodge of Ireland for new titles for Bel­\nfast the following were granted :-The \"Rising Star,\" \n\" Templemore True Blues,\" \" Ravenhill Guiding Star \" \nin place of \" Kensit Crusaders,\" \" Royal Sovereign \" \ninstead of \" Sandy Row Heroes.\" A scheme for t~ie \nformation of a Political Committee to attend to regis­\ntration matters and to consolidate the Orange vote ju \nMunicipal and Parliamentary Elect.ions_ in the Ci~Y. of \nDublin was approved of. A resolution i~ the foHowmg \nterms was sent up by the Central_ Committee: - T1?,at, \nas the position of Lord Rossmore m t~e Orange Institu­\ntion is ambiguous, the Central Co~m1tt~e beg to re}ilort \nto Grand Lodge that neither resignation, suspeus1ou , \nor (sic.) expulsion of his lordship has been forwarded to \nOommittee.\" I,t was then proposed by Brother Thomas \nM'Cormick, D.G.M., seconded by Brother John ~oyd, \nD.G.M., aucl resolved:-\" That it be an instruction to \nthe County of Monaghan Grand L?~ge to report to \nGrand Lodge as to the stat1;1s a~d ~?sit10n ~f Lord Ros~­\nmore in the Orange Inst1tut1on.

A. M.W . \nTHE UNIVERSITY WITH THE GALVANIZED­\nIRON ROOF. \ni r HOSE of us who were at the meeting of the Catho-\nlic Graduates As sociation, at the Gresham Hotel, \non last Friday night, were no less-amazed than de­\nlighte~l to learn on the authority of lVIr. John Mac­\nNeill, B.A ., that the Gaelic League collects the stupen­\ndous sum of £20,000· per annum. The occasion of the \nmeeting was to start a fighting policy on the University \nQuestion ; and the plan of ca:mpaign propounded was \ntha~ the people of Ireland should put their hands :n \nthen· pockets and pay for the University Institute \nthemselves .. \nSome of the members , like the ·present writer, ex­\npressed th_emselves gre_atly dubious as to the possibility \nof extractrng voluutanly another £20-,000 from an over­\ntaxed people every year, but l\\fr. lVIacNeill darkly hinted \nthat the counsols of fear were the counsels of treachery \na·na as proof of the practicability of the proposal, stated \nthat the sum collected annually by the Gaelic League \nfor language purposes was £20,000. This cheering \nstatement was endorsed by Mr. Pearse, B.L., who ex­\nplained that the public collection was a mere fraction \nof the whole. It is intensely cheering to think that \nso ~ollossal a sum can be voluntarily raised in a poverty­\nst~·wken countr1, and from a people so sodden i.n \nmisery,_ bu_t still o~e doubts whethi:ir this amazing \ngenerosity 1s a suffi.crnnt ground for puttina a further \nlnu·den upon them. b . \nBy far the most i~portant and practicable suggestion \nwas put to the meetmg by Mr. J.

Addressing himself chiefly to the fman­\ncial question, he writes: -\"Let a meeting be summoned \na·t Dublin by a Committee of prominent University \nmen. Invite all who are in favour of fair play to come \nand help in the movement. Let a complete scheme \nsuch as that outlined by Father Finlay be put before the· \nmeeting, and the details settled in a preliminary way. \nThen discuss the first and most difficult question of all­\nthe money; how much money iii necessary, and whethe1· \nwe can hope to get it. Father Finlay suggests that \n£10,000 be i:aised annually, and that the buildings \nshould be of a cheap and temporary nature. In my \nhumble opinion, it would be far bette1· to attempt to \nraise one large sum . than to have an annual hat going \nround as the chief oi sole sustenance of our University. \nEveryone knows how tired we get of repeated request \nfor aid, no matter how deserving the object; whereas 1 \nsingle final appeal will often excite our benevolence, and \nits .finality will even stimulate and expand our genero• \nsity. One mighty effort is often easier than a prolonged \nstrain.'' \nFather Finlay suggested that £10,000 a year·collected \nannually in the various dioceses, and spent on scholar­\nships to be given to students from the several dioceses \nwould meet £he practical financial difficulties of his \nscheme. His scheme is an ad, interim one. Dr . \nConnor Maguire suggests a full-blown scheme providing \nan income of £20,000 or £30,000. At 3 per· cent. \n£1,000,000 would produce £30,000 a....year. Is the Irish \nrace at home and abroad equal to subscribing this ca.pita! \nsum 1 A quarter of a million at 3 pe1· cent. would pro­\nduce £7,600 a year, and the members of the Church of \nEngland's Faithful Garrison in Irel_and recently set \nabout collecting that sum by way of providing· against \na possible shrinkage in the funds for paying their mini• \ns~ers heavy_ salaries. ~ertainly Dr. Maguire's sugges­\ntion of makmg an heroic effort to collect the capital sum \n-whatever that sum may be-is worthy of careful at­\ntention. There is no great security in annual collec­\ntions. The twenty or so millions of the Irish race at \nhome and abroad that we so often bear of could raise a \ncapital of a million by subscribing a shilling a bead. \nThe appeal for a capital sum would--0r anyway should \n-have a great effect on the wealthy Irish-Americans. \nIrish-Americans stand considerably to gain in many \nways by the moral and intellectual upraising of the \nmothe; race at home. There is besides a psychologicr-\\ \nforce 1n a fine wholesale demand that is altogether ab• \n11ent from a very moderate a.nd more or less begging \nrequest \nThe Grea.t Southern and Western Railwa.y, as Mr. \nSexton showed at _the recent meeting, performed a very \nremarkable financial fea.t. It purchased some business \nthat brought in a. revenue of about £100,000 a year, \nand to purchase that £100,000 a year it created a ue,v \npreference capital of £4,000,000 a.t an a.nnual charge \nover the heads of the Ordinary Stockholders of from \n£160,000 to ~170,000. It is not every person that \nwould be earned away by a flight of financial genius to \nraise a sum of £4,000,000 in order to purchase a. loss of \n£60,000 or £70,000 a year. E:ven the National Assur­\nanc~ Co., of ~hich Mr. F. C. Pilkington, J.P., D.L ., is \na. director, might not blush at such a. master stroke as \n~ba.t. Is it any w~nder that shareholders represent­\nmg £813,283 of Ordmary Stock are anxious for au \ninquiry 1 \nThe poll taken. at the recent meeting was declared last \nTuesday week; it was too late for comment from us in \nour last issue. It will be remembered that the directors \nuse~ the pro~ies to stifle the proposed inquiry into the \nbusmess affairs of the Company, and . the Chairman at \nthe meeting announced the proxies before they bad been \nchecked. Sir William badly needs being checked as well \nns the proxies. \nAt the meeting the unauthorised announcement of the \nunchecked Sir William was that the proxies-which ex­\ncluded the votes of those who were to vote personally:­\namounted to :-For the directors who used.them to stop \nan inquiry 2,128 proxies representing £2,452,205; for \nthe inquiry into the business of a Company, one of \nwhose directors is one of the financial giants of the Na• \ntional Assurance Co., 893 proxies representing .£779,026. \nAt the adjourned meeting, and after the proxies, if not \nBir William, bad been checked, the Chairman made the \nfollowing announcement, which included the votes pei·-",

The Lord Ohief Baron is desirous of O'reas­\nmg the- path that leads to T\\:inity. He is o:lfoiina a \nmedal for competi~ion. This light of the lay Cath~lic \nw~rld and President of the Clougowes Union, said : -\n\" Of course, Trinity College was now open to all, but \nat the same time in the competitions for the hiaher \np.laces in Trinity College, the fellowships especially,\"' the \nmajority of the competitors were non-C,itholics. They \nknew that Mr . Kelleher had a gre,it success, obtaining \nhigher marks in ma .thema,tics than had ever been at­\ntained before, but he was an exception. As m11,the­\nmatics wa.s a. subject which in Trinity College counted \nhigher than any other subject in the competition \nfor fellowships, naturally every competitor for a \nfellowship in Trinity College must study mathem atics \nand must attain a competent knowledge of that sub­\nject. And with the generality of schools that educate \nstudents who looked forward to being thereafter Fellows \nof Trinity College, necessarily the subject of math e­\nmatics must be made, at lea.st, a first-class subject, if \nnot the very most important subject of the school; and \nfor that reason, after some reflection he had determined \nto found a medal for mathematics-of course, with the \napproval of the Rector and Prefect of Studies. (Ap­\nplause).\" In the teeth of the Bishops' warning, the \nLord Chief Baron flung his paltry medal to the Catho­\nlic lads of Olongowes in order to stimulate them to com­\npete for Fellowships in T'rinity, and the R ector of Clon­\ngowes,_ Very Rev. Vincent Byrne, as it were, taking up \nthe paltry piece of metal, said:-\" The Community and \nthe members of the Olongowes Union were most grate­\nful to .their President, and on the part of the Cbmmu­\nnity he thanked him for the medal which he had so \ngenerously determined to give to the students. He \nthought the Ohief Baron had chosen very wisely the \nsubject for competition. Ou his own pa.rt, on the part \nof the Prefect of Studies, on the part of the Community, \nand on the part of the present boys of Clongowes, he \nthanked the Chief Baron for his very great kindness \nand g.enei:osity in this matter.\" The newspaper report \ndoes not tell us whether or not at this point the British \nmilitary band played \"Croppies Lie Down. \" \nGeoffrey Henry Browne Browne--Gutbrie, Baron of \nOranmore and Browne , is not the only unconscious \nhumourist who is deeply interested in the Teachers and \n\"the King\" incident. The Rev. Dudley Fletcher B .D., \nManager of Cussadell and Mullaghnaneane National \nSchools, Sligo, bas a long letter in the hospitable \ncolumns of the libeller of Oanon Mclnerney, of Mon­\nday last, on the subject. He was present at the dinner. \nHaving described the scene connected with \" the King\" \nincident, Mr. Dudley Fletcher, B,.D., says:-\" It is \npainful to me to have to record these facts. But can \nany Irishman who loves his country, and has its wel­\nfare at heart, keep silence in the face of them 7 As \nthe Marquis of Londonderry uruly remarked, 'It must \nbe disastrous ,to the interests of the rising generation \nif they were to have inculcated in them feelings of dis­\nloyalty,' and what other feelings will their spiritual \npastol\"s and masters inculcate in them who are capable \nof acting as these acted at the Sligo bang net 7 Will \nnot the result be t'll.at tlie youth of Ireland will be \nturned away from the service of their King and country \ni'1 the most honourable and lucrative positions, such as \nthe Army, the Navy, the police, the Civil Service 1· that \neven in private commercial enterprises they will be \nlooked upon with suspicion, as being re~els at heart ; and \nso will be driven by the stress of poverty to swell the \nranks of the Clan-na-Gael in the United States, there \nto stiir up miscliief against England, and to prevent tnat \nclose friendship whicli ought to subsist between us and \nour America,n cousins ! \" We fear th.at our readers not-\nwith standing their Irish good nature, will heartily en­\njoy the \" pain \" of Rev. Dudley Fletcher and wish him \n\". more o' that to you.\" \nWe have ree'ivea ·from Mr. C. Bull, Suffolk St., Dub­\nlin, a selection of cards containing religious exercises. \nThe cards are of neat design and execution, and are \nprinted by l\\fr. Bull in Dublin. \nWe have been asked to remind our readers that intend·­\ning coiiij_1e€itors at Feis na Mumhan, 1905, should for­\nw:i.rd their entries at once. No entries will be received \nl,Lter than the 1st of July next. This year's Feis will be \nheld on the Earl of Keumare's demesne-in the \nlovely spot where it was held last year. .1'~ul.l information \nabout the proposed subscription dance, to be held in con­\nuection with the Munster l<'eis next August,. will be given \nin the circular about to be issued to Munster Gaelic \nLeague branches. \n'vV'e hear whispers of bigotry in connection with the \nCork Steam Packet Company. Of the six directors three \nare Catholics and three non-Catholics, so if the former \nare any good,and are not mere tame \"tolerance-provers,\" \nthere ought to be little or no scope for bigotry. Mr. \n\"Walter De Foubert is managing director. vVe are not in \npossession of details, and so cannot say whether or not \nthe report that reaches us complaining of bigotry is borne \nout by the facts. \nMilitary bands do not appear to be exactly a red rag \nto the Corporation of Limerick. A member of. that body \npi;oposed that neither the Mayor nor any official of the \nCorporation officially attended the regatta or sports if an \nEugfish military band was engaged. A.lderman Daly \nsa:'l'd he took the resolution as a vote of censure on himself \nfor having attended the regatta as Mayor under the con­\nditions sought to be condemned. Eventually the resolu­\ntion was not as much as seconded. Evidently a Tommy \nAtkins band is not a red rag to the members of the Lime­\nrick Corporation. \nw_e have received the following letter accompanying a \nremittance of 14s. :-.o. c .. ,11 ... ,-I enclose P .O . value 14s. \nsubscribed some weeks ago by a few members of the Mur­\nrintown Branch of the Gaelic League for the Language \nFund.

He showed that up to a \npenny m the pound of the ratable valuation can be \nlevied for the purpose of technical education, and as \nthis has been held to include 'the teaching of modern \nlanguages as 'ivell as physics, chemistry, mathematics \nand the like, it seemed possible tlrn.t even now the \n• County Councils had power to strike a rate which \ncould be employed for the endowment of a University \nInstitute, or at least a short, amending Act would \neasily give t,hem this power. \nThat the County Councils of Ireland would readily \nstrike a rate for that purpose 110 one doubts. If the \nrate went to the upk eep of a. University Institution of \nacknowledged standing and merit, like University Col­\nlege, Stephen's Green , and not to some merely nebulous \nestablishment, it would be given the monopoly. If the \ngrant went to endow schola.rships to which ea.ch C ouncil \nshould have a right of nomin ation, a local interest \nwould be given to the question which should render the \nstriking of t,he rnte the more popular. \nJ . C . Mc \\VAL 'l'ER . \nA REVIEW O.F EDUCATION IN IRELAND-III.­\n( C ont·inu.ed.} \nDown to 1878 Catholic Intermed iate Education was \nabsolutely unendowed . There were endowments of Inter­\nmediate Education-and rich ones-but non-Catholics \nexclusively enjoyed them. In that year Earl Cairns intro­\nduced the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Bill, and it \nwas without much difficulty passed into law. The sum of \n£1,000,000 out of the surplus fund of the Disesfai~lished \nChurch was set aside for the purpose. All Insh In­\ntermediate Schools might wip their share of the annual \nrevenue which that capital afforded, according as each \nproved its efficiency in op~n competition. But the \nCatholic and the non-Catholic Schools entered the arena \nunder widely different circumstances. The . latter had \ntheir endowments , and a supposed educational supe• \nriority. The Catholic Schools ~a~ no endowmei:ts, and \na supposed inferiority. The privilege of competm_g was \nsimply given to them; that was all.. Th~ pres~1ge of \nnon-Catholic education had become a trachtion rn Ire­\nland. Quite naturally. • I have been told by some of \nthose who were teaching in Catholic Schools at tl~e \ntime, that they sent their pup~ls to the first year's exami­\nnations with fear and trembling. But the result was a \nrevela,tion. Their pupils left their co~petitors behind ; \nand their victory, year by year ~ver_ smce, has brought \neducational prestige over to their side. The Interme­\ndiate System has had this importa~1t effect : it has 1:°ade \nCatholic teachers and pupils conscious _of an educational \nsuperiority of which they were unconscious before. T~ey \nhave come to believe in themselves; and non-C~thohcs, \namongst them Dr. Archdall the Protestant bishop o-f \nKillaloe, and Dr . Bunbury , Protestant bishop of Lime ­\nrick in his notorious Synodal Address t1uee years ago, \nbav~ openly admitted their super~01:it.y. . ';1-'he \nsystem has this other impo!·tant result: 1t 1s m prrnc1ple \na denominat.ional system. . '.rhe old subterfuge of refus­\ning public money to denominational Coll~ge~ can be con­\nsistently :resorted to no more. The pn_n~1ple of secu­\nlarism has· ceased to be sacred. Competitive tests have \nexploded its excellence; the ~egisl~tu;re itself has rele­\ngated it to· the past as a: p~bhc prmc1pl_e. lf I ~m re­\nminded that the Intermediate system 1s educat10nally \ndefective, that victory under it does not connote true \neducational efficiency, I ~·eadily assent. Public com­\npetition has its right plac;e when one's education, such \nas it may be, is completed; but F think that introduced \nbefore that term it tends to vitiate the process of educa­\ntion. But here again, Catholics have not created the \nsystem;· they have acepted it for want of better. They \nF\nRED LEWIS and 00. 'S PE!RiFUMES AND TOI. \nLET REQUISITES; 1RISH MANUFACTURE. \nhave aone into an arena not of -their own choice, and \nthey have come out with the laur_els .. If, therefor~, \nCatholic Intermediate Schools be strll said to have their \nshortcomings, let the blame be not put on the~, gut on \nthe system imder which ~b~y have to wo~k. It_1s wor~hy \nof remark that the Chnstian Brothers Schools, which \nare absolutely Oatholic, are of admitted excellence. They \nhave uever come uuder the influence of Government \no-tlicialclom 1101· have they been originally designed under \nGovernme1~t patronage, bub preci'sely against it. ~ore­\nover it is doubtful whether since they have partially \ncha1{ged their primary character a~d ~one und~r the In­\ntermediate System, they have mamtamed their general \nexcellence as primary schools. \nLet us now consider University education. As a \nCa tholic nation, it is our anomalous fate to be ac­\nquainted with non-Catholic Un~versities o~ly. Non­\nCatholic thought permeates our literature, science, _a~d \nart. \\Ve have been reared in that atmosphere. As Ill \nour fathers' time, to s·peak of the gentry was to m~an \nProtestants; so the delusion of identifying P1:otestant1sm \nor secularism with University life came upon us also, \nand is living still-a lingering relic of the past. We. \nhave thus been brought by the force of _ci~cumstances to \nlook on University life and the Catholic idea as alm?st \nincompatible. Little blame ~o us : we ~ave I;een _demed \n• the opportunity and the 1:ight ?f \"'.1tnessmg m our \nmidst the w ork of a Oathohc U mv ersity untramm elled \nby di-tliculties. It has been the persi~tent policy of our \nneighbours to represent the Catholic Church as the \nnurse of obscurantism. They first robbed, and then \nreviled her • and a few Catholics help to keep the illu­\nsion alive, forgetting that tl;iey are defaming their own \nm other and cutting their own throats. ~hat. was the \ncondition of thinas before the Royal Umvers1t y came \nin 1879; but it is° so no longer. The Roy al University \nis not in strictness a University at all; it is simply an \nexamining body. There can be no doubt that its De gre~s \nrequire much more positive knowledge than ~hose of 'I'n­\nnity Co llege; nevertheless, many have obtamed them by \nprivate study as well as those who have undergone a \nforma.J course of teaching; and anyone who has had ex­\nperience in these things k1;1o~vs the differ~nce which that \nm akes in most cases. Ti:uuty College gives Degrees to \ncanclidatee from private study also. \nAs uuder the Intermediate System, so also in the \nR oyal University, the Catholic Co lleges had t? enter the \nlists in their poyerty, whilst the non-Catholic Oolleges \nhad their endowments. The three Queen's Colleges had \nbeen at work for thirty years. £1001,000 of public \nmoney was originally spent on their buildings and \nequipment; and they enjoyed a r~venue of £30-,000 a \nyear. In an able p,1.mphlet published last year, Dr. \nD elaney, S.J.,* poin~,s out that \" the. estimates for th_e \npast three years, 1901-2-3, show that the total expendi­\nture on the three Colleges in these years amounted r~­\nspectively to £34,098, £34,916, and £34,966; and tlus \nlast sum £34,966 is also the estimate for the cm-rent \nyear 1903-4.\" Including the charge involved in t~e \noriginal outlay, the total cost to the taxpayer 1s \n£38,000 a year. The C atholic College had to \ncompete against those three Colleges, with their en­\ndowments and their prestige, in which the education \ngiven, according to Dr. Johnstone Stoney, \"aims at \nbeing the best which the twentieth century is able to \ndevelop.\" t Let us see some of the results. From the \nyear 1884 to 1896, of the candidates from the C atholic \nUniversity College, Dublin, who passed the B.A. Degree \nof the Royal U uiversity, 80. 7 per cent. took Honom ·s \nand E ,xbibitions; of those from Blackrock College, 92.5 \nper cent. took Honours and Exhibitions. On the other \nside, of those couclidates from the Cork Queen's College, \nonly 60.6 per cent. took Honours and Exhibitions; .of \nthose from the Galway Queen's College,· 68.2 per cent. \ntook Honours and Exhibitions. Again, from the year \n1893 to 1900, in the medical examinations of the Royal . \nUniversity, the following shows the proportion of those \nwho took Exhibitions to those who passed the examina-\n•.-1 Pica. for }',ii,, Play: by Rev.

The man Coote, \nof Tyrone, a Justice of the Peace, has stimulated inter­\nest in the Orange Inquisition. It will be remembered that \neven .the Prote.stant incumbent of Clogher, Canon Hare­\n~o~ter, was dragged before this infamous Orange Inqui­\ns1t10n for unw orthy conduct as a Protestant and as· an \nOrangeman. vVe state the charge in the words quoted \nfrom the judgmenti delivered by Mi·. Justice Barton: -\n\" It appears that the defendant brought the Canon 's \nname before the lodge as having been guilty of un­\nworthy conduct as a Protestant minister and a member \nof th<'i lodge by aiding and abetting this Roman Catho­\nlic girl and usii}g his influence against the boycott of the \nschool.\" The Orange Inquisition of Ireland is cer­\ntainly not without interest to others besides the humble \nsewing instructress of Carntall \" non-sectarian\" Na­\ntional School. \nA village sing-song cannot be held in Ireland under \nany title less than a \" grand concert;\" there are any \namount of \" grand \" functionaries in the Oran,ge In­\nquisition; there are \" grand \" masters, \" grand \" chap­\nlains, \"grand\" secretary, \"deputy grand\" chaplains, \ncounty \" grand \" officers and \" grand \" committees. \nThe Rev. Bishop Stack, Clones; the Protestant Bishop \nof Ossory, Kilkenny; the Protestant Bishop of Derry \nand Raphoe are amongst the \" grand \" chaplains; the \nProtestant Bishop of Cashel, the notorious Dr. O'Hara, \nis one of the \" deputy grand \" chaplains. One Major \nA. vV-. Bailey, of the T.0.D. Lodge, is \"grand\" trea­\nsurer. \nAmongst the applications at a recent meeti11g of the \nGrand Orange Lodge of Ireland for new titles for Bel­\nfast the following were granted :-The \"Rising Star,\" \n\" Templemore True Blues,\" \" Ravenhill Guiding Star \" \nin place of \" Kensit Crusaders,\" \" Royal Sovereign \" \ninstead of \" Sandy Row Heroes.\" A scheme for t~ie \nformation of a Political Committee to attend to regis­\ntration matters and to consolidate the Orange vote ju \nMunicipal and Parliamentary Elect.ions_ in the Ci~Y. of \nDublin was approved of. A resolution i~ the foHowmg \nterms was sent up by the Central_ Committee: - T1?,at, \nas the position of Lord Rossmore m t~e Orange Institu­\ntion is ambiguous, the Central Co~m1tt~e beg to re}ilort \nto Grand Lodge that neither resignation, suspeus1ou , \nor (sic.) expulsion of his lordship has been forwarded to \nOommittee.\" I,t was then proposed by Brother Thomas \nM'Cormick, D.G.M., seconded by Brother John ~oyd, \nD.G.M., aucl resolved:-\" That it be an instruction to \nthe County of Monaghan Grand L?~ge to report to \nGrand Lodge as to the stat1;1s a~d ~?sit10n ~f Lord Ros~­\nmore in the Orange Inst1tut1on. E ,v1dently Lo1d \nRossmore has made himself obnoxious to the gentle \nOrange Inq uisi tiou . • \nThis secret society of which so many Protestant \nBishops, D.0.'s., J.-~'s., and the_l~ke are ~~mben is \nvery careful of avo1dm1!; comprbmismg publicity. . ~t \nwerks in the dark.

The man Coote, \nof Tyrone, a Justice of the Peace, has stimulated inter­\nest in the Orange Inquisition. It will be remembered that \neven .the Prote.stant incumbent of Clogher, Canon Hare­\n~o~ter, was dragged before this infamous Orange Inqui­\ns1t10n for unw orthy conduct as a Protestant and as· an \nOrangeman. vVe state the charge in the words quoted \nfrom the judgmenti delivered by Mi·. Justice Barton: -\n\" It appears that the defendant brought the Canon 's \nname before the lodge as having been guilty of un­\nworthy conduct as a Protestant minister and a member \nof th<'i lodge by aiding and abetting this Roman Catho­\nlic girl and usii}g his influence against the boycott of the \nschool.\" The Orange Inquisition of Ireland is cer­\ntainly not without interest to others besides the humble \nsewing instructress of Carntall \" non-sectarian\" Na­\ntional School. \nA village sing-song cannot be held in Ireland under \nany title less than a \" grand concert;\" there are any \namount of \" grand \" functionaries in the Oran,ge In­\nquisition; there are \" grand \" masters, \" grand \" chap­\nlains, \"grand\" secretary, \"deputy grand\" chaplains, \ncounty \" grand \" officers and \" grand \" committees. \nThe Rev. Bishop Stack, Clones; the Protestant Bishop \nof Ossory, Kilkenny; the Protestant Bishop of Derry \nand Raphoe are amongst the \" grand \" chaplains; the \nProtestant Bishop of Cashel, the notorious Dr. O'Hara, \nis one of the \" deputy grand \" chaplains. One Major \nA. vV-. Bailey, of the T.0.D.

          "text": "Sean Mac Curtain of the Vortex radio show (THURS­\nDAY 8-9, WIRED I 03FM) welcomes the reggae renais­\nsance, guides you through the web and finishes with \ndrum'n'bass, again. \nRETURN OF REGGAE \nReggae returns to its Irish spiritual home in May when \nCork hosts Ireland's first ever Roots'N'Reggae Festival. \nThe weekend festival sponsored by Guinness will uncov­\ner _some forty acts. The acts will feature in a free city \nwide pub trail, which will cover some 21 of the city cen­\ntre pubs. The interesting line-up includes Salsa Celtica, \nScotland's masters of the Latin Groove and Birmingham­\nbased reggae band X.M.Y. Zion Train Sound System from \nLondon will also feature along with Black Slate, Maroon \nTown and Mafia & Fluxy. Leeside-based sound systems \nincluding Jah Love and Echo Chamber are not forgotten \nabout either. The festival being the first to celebrate \nroots and reggae in Ireland couldn't have picked a better \nlocation then Cork. It was here in the 80's that reggae \nruled and visiting sound systems and toasting M.Cs, \nfrom both England and Jamaica, were a regular occur­\nrence. BBC Radio One reggae jock, Ezeke Sunshine \nbegan a long radio career while on a two-year sojourn \nby the Lee. The association of Guinness with Reggae and \nroots might not make immediate sense but the beverage \nis one of the most popular names to drop on reggae \ntracks. Who could have predicted 18 months ago that \nGuinness would be associated with the coolest things in \nclubland? With Roots in the POD, Telefunkin in Cork \nand their sponsorship of this years grooviest festival­\nSouthern Soul and Disco in June, the appearance of the \nGuinness logo on the flyer can now be taken like a sort \nof dubbers Quality Mark. \nDANCING IN A WEB \nThere was a time when searching the Internet for news \non Irish dance music and culture would prove a pretty \nfruitless pursuit. Obscure sites more often than no~, did­\nn't turn up on search engines and unless you were rn \nthe know as to their address, you had no alternative \n. then to rely on the print media for information and \ncomment. However this has changed dramatically in the \nlast year and ·now, the real deal on what Is ~oing on In \nIrish' clubland can be found in cyberspace. To help you \nalong the way, we look at some of the best sites at the \nmoment. \nTop of the pile is the new e-mag (if that is what you call \nthem?) from Media Hustlers 'ETRONIK'. Issue one ca_n \nbe found at www.44k .com and is both visually appealing \nand contains lots of good interviews and reviews. \nRichard Brophy, of Hot Press fame, lines up quality \nreviewers with the likes of Glen Brady covering \nBreakbeat, Billy Scurry covering techno and Mark Dixon \ncovering House. There is a very comprehensive listings \nsection (covering both UK and Ireland) and interviews \nwith amongst others Photek and Derrick May. \nJust as impressive in the depth and uali of its writing \nis 'MUSE' which can be located at www.muse.ie Set up \nby Ti net its brief is wider covering all types of music but \nits writing team is just as impressive with Donal Dineen, \nDonal Scannell and John Collins regular contributors. \nUpdated weekly, a recent edition gave an opportunity to \nhear an exclusive Chemical Brothers mix. An A-Z of \nJungle has been running since the start of the year and \nthe club listings focus on what is new rather repeating \nthe same listings weekly. Top-notch interviews with the \nlikes of Massive Attack are a regular feature as well. \nTrailing in at third place to these two is the clubimusic \nsite.A mind-blowing site when it was launched first, it \nhas suffered due to lack of updates. It concentrates \nheavily on the Kitchen/Ri-Ra/lnflux scene and is worth \nvisitin if ·ust to check the graP-hics. Find it at: \nhtt ://imusic.com/clubimusic/dublin/ \nAmusingly enough Ireland's first comprehensive dance \nmusic site was actually hosted by the University of \nLimerick server.

This issue it's Conor O Dwyer . Yet another one of the fresh new \ndrum'n'bass talent, Shannonside, Conor has achieved a high level of national \nattention in a short Djing career. His early influences were the hard-core/break­\nbeat scene, wh ich he picked up on through tapes floating around his school. \nWh ile still at school he achieved every school kids dream {these days!) and got \nhis 25-minute bedroom mix tape featured on the Mickey Mac dance show. Donal \nScannell would later pay him the same compliment and play his mix tape on the \nexcellent, much-lamented 'Insomnia' show on Radio Ireland. It was on this show \nbeing broadcast across the national airways that Conor's most radical assertion \nwas first aired. He claimed to the nation that Pallasgreen was the \"spiritual home \nof drum'n' bass\".As no one ever objected to this, we can only presume that \nthere was an element of truth in it. Now a college going student, Conor has \nplayed all the main underground city clubs at this stage guesting at $kint, Silk and \nBlue Label at different stages. While his two year old Djing career has seen him \nplay every style of drum 'n'bass, Conor feels the next year will see a return to a \nfunkier style. Like other drum'n'bass DJ's in the city, his ma in hope is that \nLimerick will soon see a regular drum'n'bass night although he admits that \"the \nscene now is an awful lot better then it was\".

          "text": "~ Qhn [bo Do □ \nThe Red Box in Dublin was the venue for the \npremiere Irish Dance music event in the coun­\ntry this year -the Smirnoff Dance Club \nAwards. \nThe awards themselves are testament to the increase \nin popularity in Dance music in Ireland -the so called \n\"underground\" scene is beginning to make it main \nstream and the decision by RTE to record the event so \nas to have an option to televise it later in the year \nsays a lot to changing opinions towards the dance \nculture in Ireland. \nThe night was a well run affair and DROP had \nnumerous correspondents at the awards to sample the \natmosphere, music and more importantly the free \nSmirnoff. After distributing loads of free copies of \nDROP to everybody in the place so that the event \nlooked as if we had paid for the whole night our- • \nselves the DROP team sat down to enjoy the awards. \nThe night was very promising, while on the main most \naward winners came from Dublin and Cork their was \na refreshing number of nominees from outside the \nPale. The fact that Cork won so many awards was \nalso refreshing. As the Red Box itself had alot of \nnominees their was a fear that the night would end up \nas a back slapping exercise for the Dublin crowd -\nfortunately this wasn't the case on the main. \nA lot was learned from this year's affair that hopefully \nwill bring it into a league of its own next year. It \n·recognised that the Dance industry in Ireland is now \nso big that it can have an awards night of its own \nand not be covered as part of another awards cere­\nmony. It covered a whole range of features in the \nDance business that hitherto were forgotten about -\ndesign of flyers, independent promoters, etc. It \nattracted so much attention that it has established itself \nas a permanent fixture for the music indu~try. It also \nsucceeded in getting nominations for all corners of the \ncountry hence recognising a growing trend outside of \nthe main cities. What was disappointing from a \nLimerick point of view was the lack of nominations for \nthe city itself. Mickey Mac was the only Limerick per­\nson nominated. Limerick didn't feature among \nnominations for best Munster club or any other award \nwhich means that either the city has a lot to learn or \nthe nomination procedure is flawed. \nUaneen Fitzsimmons of No Disco fame was MC for \nthe night and probably would have commanded \neveryone's attention were it not for the dancers either \nside of her, clad in nothing but a layer of red plastic. \nHighlights of the night would have been a recorded \nmessage from Carl Cox thanking every one for the \naward contrasted with the lowlight of David Holmes \nnot turning up for his award (or subsequently the Bud \nThud in Galway the next night). \nCork featured strongly in the Awards witn 4 out of the \n13 award winners hailing from the City by the Lee. \nDublin picked up the same amount and the rest were \npicked up by Galway, Ranger and Britain (Carl Cox). \nWinners of the awards were: \n( Best Regional Club Night -Leinster) \nGenius \n(Best Regional Club Night -Connach) \nClub UR \n(Best Regional Club Night -Ulster ) \nShindig \n----\n( Best Regional Club Night .. -Mu~ster) Sweat ______ > \n( Best Independent Promoter ) \nInflux \n( Best Club Flyer Design ) \nGenius-Aiden Grenlle \n(Best Dance Radio Programme/Station)'/ \nRadio Friendly",

Eamonn Moran was present at \nwhat DROP correctly predicted would be a \"Bud Thumping time\" in \nGalway . \nThe crowds started to arrive early on Friday evening amid rumours \nthat David Holmes would not be playing. The ticket sellers at Zhivago \nRecords however were reassuring everybody that the man hadn't \nmissed his plane! On Friday night the IKON club had received the \nfinal word on the David Holmes rumours as we arrived at around \n1 0p.m . Due to recording commitments he would unfortunately not be \nplaying. The crowd outside and those who had already gone in to see \nJohnny Moy were obviously disappointed. Organisers and promoters \nhowever were determined not to disappoint the Holmes fans. Howie B \nfresh from his respite after touring as a support and producer for the \n'U2 Pop' album and world tour proved to be a more than adequate \nsubstitute. An added bonus of a free ticket to the following nights \nshow w ith the Propellorheads was offered to everybody who decided \nto go in regardless of the lineup. Howie B strayed along way from the \nambient sounds of his 'Music for Babies' album of a couple of years \nago, playing a thumping mix of Big Beat which occasionally ventured \ninto Drum and Bass. Familiar m ixes were given a whole new dimen­\nsion by Howie, who proved once again why the world's biggest band \ndemanded and some might say needed him on their tour and album. \nSanchez was not so much thumping but equally as good in his own \nright. He classically mixed funk, disco, jazz and all round 'feel good \nAmer ican house to an ecstatic crowd with his closing half hour which \ncontained a superb Police . (Yes, that's the band Sting was in) mix \nwhich stole the show sending the crowd wild and shouting for more \nonce it ended. Sanchez truly hasn't lost his edge and remains one of \nthe best in the business. \nSaturday afternoon proved to be the most pleasant surprise of the \nweekend however, as the King's Head Bar provided us with a dose of \n'Just what the doctor ordered after a great night out on the town' -\nBASS ODDESSY. The Cork trio played live to an extremely chilled \nand relaxed crowd. They really and truly stole the show from the \nAmerican hip hop DJ's who had played before them with their sam­\nples of Roni Size (who seemed to be in every DJs record bag last \nweekend), Wu Tang Clan and many more. Excellent show Boys! \nStraight on from there then to Leisureland and once again Howie B, \nwho was this time supporting the Propellorheads. The much larger \ncrowd than the previous night seemed to please him more with his set \nbeing a much faster and livelier affair than the previous night. The \nProppellorheads then came on amid an excellent light show (James \nBond lasers!) playing familiar tracks from their latest album and giv­\ning them much more base than was possible in the studio. \nHungry for more we then headed to local Salthill club Liquid at \naround midnight to a super, but somewhat out of date, mix from one \nof the local lads. A much younger crowd of locals were doing their \nusual Saturday night thing -Music that makes you want to dance until \nyou have to wring your T-shirt. -Two great nights without even getting \nto the super Sunday lineup which included the Chemical Brothers. \nOnce again, well done Budweiser and Galway. Next time I'll save up \nso that I can afford the three nights.",

As for elsewhere I think Manchester \nUnited will be extremely lucky in that their new single \nwhich I believe is called something like \"Get on up for the \nchampions\" can be changed to the better rhyming \"Get on \nup for the runners up\". \nYes, by now of course Arsenal are champions of England. \nThe Red Mancunian scum are dethroned and their humilia­\ntion compounded and completed by their final annihilation \nat Old Trafford on May 3rd by a rampant Leeds United. \nThe slaughter started as early as the third minut,e when \nGary Kelly's corner was powered home by Leeds Giant \nSouth African centre back Lucas Radebe . \nOn ten minutes Leeds were two-nil up as Bruno \nRibeiro carved his way through Man Utd's defence before \npoking an inch perfect pass to Jimmy floyd Hasselbaink \nwho gratefully stabbed the ball under the hapless \nSchmeichel.At two down one would've expected a con­\ncerted fight back from Alex Ferguson's men but it were as \nif they'd grown accustomed to their new-found whipping \nboy status. They were a shambles, their midfield out of \nsync and impotent, their strike force negated, their flat \nback four-neither four nor flat. In truth Leeds should've \ngone in at half time more than goals to the good, better \nfinishing and execution of their seven first half corners \nwould've seen Leeds widen the gap. \nBoth Alfie Haaland and Harry Kewell saw goal bound \nefforts saved only by the crossbar. George Graham must \nhave chastised his players for the level of mercy they were \nshowing their hosts for the game had barely restarted \nwhen in the 47th minute Leeds made it three again. Kelly \nwas involved as Leeds swe·pt forward, his cross scorched, \nchest high, across the face of goal and was met by the head \nof Robert Molenar. His diving Hulk Baring stark resem­\nblance to a 747 making an emergency landing. \nThree Nil up and cruising Leeds continued to create \nchances while Man Utd. continued to wither and no-one \nwas particularly surprised when Leeds made it four on 73 \nminutes.Again Ribero set Hasselbank away only for his \nshot to be blocked down by Denis Irwin.Alas the ball fell \nstraight to the feet of the incoming Kewell who volleyed \npast the scrambling Peter Schmeichel. Three minutes \nbefore the ref put Man Utd. out of their misery, \nHasselbank nettted his second and Leed's fifth running first \nstraight at the Man Utd defence before going to the right \nof Scmichels goal and unleashing an unstoppable piledriver. \nThe reds of Manchester vanquished, the whites of \nYorkshire avenged with interest, the Reds of Highbury, the \nReds of highbury champions. \nOh yeah , and finally I betcha Rangers will nick it off Celtic \non the last day!",

Born into a dysfunctional family Don \n• has a history of brushes with the law since he was as \nyoung as 11 years old when he found himself in a \nremand home. His music has always been a large ele­\nment in his life. He was introduced to the Harmonica \nat the age of 7 wheri he was hospitalised for \nTuberculosis. \nBy 22 Don was a musician and travelled Europe busking, 8 \nyears later he wrote a song that was debuted on The La~e \nLate Show -where all things great are born!! The song went \nstraight to No . 2 in the charts. Since then Don has had an \naccomplished career and has diversified into acting and teach­\ning. He is starred in ''The Name of the Father\" as Joe \nMcAndrew, Head of IRA (yeah the guy who set the prison \nguard on fire!) and has also starred in. a Channel 4 series. \nLast month Don released his latest album entitled \"Just Don \nBaker\". This is his first acoustic album and proves his com­\nmand of the guitar is as good as the harmonica (well okay \nmaybe a bit exaggerated). The album contains 14 tracks around \nIO of which are belonging to Don himself the other four are \ntraditional tunes except for a Donovan song featuring on track \nI 0. The songs are perfect for that hungover morning easy lis­\ntening in the front room -just load up the Don Baker CD and \nlisten to the master sing the blues. \nWith a gig just cancelled in the Warehouse on the Dock road due to \nillness, fans of Don Baker should expect him in the city shortly to \nmake up for the cancellation.",

Anything we make out of the band goes straight back \ninto it. Next on the list is a decent PA. Transport to gigs is a \nmajor problem.\" \nThe group feel that there is a growing interest among \nLimerick music fans in original local talent but the venues \naren't there at the moment to support the new vibrancy in \nLimerick music. That might all change with the Warehouse \nat Dolan's hopes drummer Shane D' arcy. \nGetting the gigs is difficult, as Cian explained, \"most \nplaces want a band to supply background music, whereas \nwe play loud heavy rock.\" \n'What I look forward to is our gigs, especially when \nyou've got a crowd that are into what you're doing. We've \nbeen together since the end of '95 and we' re at a position \nnow where we 're known around town. We played the \nSavoy and Costelloe's recently and we got decent crowds \nthere.\" \nA Hot Press review of their debut demo , Sunday Songs, \ncalled the act \"unashamedly heavy metal.\" \nThe band resents being pigeon-holed as a just another \nrun-of-the-mill death squad and guitarist Stephen Ryan list­\ned their influences as diverse as Madness, the Beastie Boys \nand the Fudgetones. \n'We'll never be a chart band, we want to build a strong \nlive fan base\" Liam said. \n\"Personally, I'd like to get to a .position where we can have \nfreedom in recording and touring with no financial pres­\nsures\", Shane said. That's an ideal scenario, like Stephen \npointed out, \"Look what happened to Kerbdog (dropped \nby Mercury last year) and they were a great band.\" \n'We practice whenever we've got any free time, usually \ntwo or three times a week. There's a weekly jamming ses­\nsion in Parteen every Sunday\" said Shane. 'We've been \nvery lucky with our practices, we've only been asked to \nturn the noise down once and at that it by was some kid. \nThere's a band we kn~w here in town who had over a \ndozen complaints to the police over the noise le~el.\" \nIf you're in an a local original act, send a tape ( rickety \nbedroom tape recorder quality or better) to DROP, 67 / 68 \nCatherine Street,_ Limerick \np~oduct \nrock n'roll \nDemol \ntooth Sunday Songs \nRecorded in Xeric Studios, September 1997.

The main \nriff beats your brain and messes with your muscle co­\nordination. \n\"This song was influenced by the Fudgetones and we had \nmajor problems getting it together,\" Liam said. \nThe next track, \"Q \" , is dedicated to that godlike anar­\nchist from Star Trek. Liam explained, \"We thought he was \ncool so we named a song after him. The lyrics? That's a \nfunny story. We were playing in Costelloe's and I had no \nlyrics so I just started screaming.

The Orangutan can now \ncommunicate with humans and is the centre of attention \nfor zoo officials. Officials hope to invest in a $1 million \namphitheatre where children can interact and talk to the \nOrangutan. \nChantek was raised in a trailer by Lynn Miles an \nAnthropologist who treated him like he was human. He was \ntoilet trained and part of his learning incorporated trips to \nMcDonalds as rewards. He can now use sign language to \nexpress approximately 150 words and scientist are hailing \nhim as \"the most exciting exhibit in the world.\" \nOrangutan mania is set to hit Atlanta with merchandising \nand Orangutan gimmicks already being devised, if zoo offi­\ncials are really sharp they may import a few tourism com­\nmittee members from the Fungee town of Dingle, a town \nstill reaping the rewards of a visiting dolphin. \nAmerican press claim Chantek may become next presi­\ndent...stranger things have happened! \nIs a bird? is it a plane? no way! \nit's . .it's .. purple runny stuff? \nLavatory fluid from low flying planes were first been \nblamed for the appearance of purple splotches on homes \nand vehicles in the Rochester area of England. However \nafter police investigation of the said splotches it was con­\ncluded that they had to have come from cherries that had \nmade their way down the digestive highway of passing \nbirds. Locals are sceptical of this however claiming that \nunless the birds had serious health problems or were very \nlarge indeed that it was impossible for them to excrete \nparcels in such sizes. \nTRAHSMITTltlG OK \nBirds eating cherries are also causing problems for people \nin Iowa where drunken flying is a cause for concern for \nmany of the state's bird lovers. It appears that among the \nthousands of song birds migrating each winter, a large por­\ntion stop off in Iowa for refreshments on the journey, a \nnumber of whom partake in the local cherries. However \ndue to early snow a lot of the cherries are on the ground \nmaking easy pickings for the birds, unfortunately or per­\nhaps fortunately for the birds the cherries are starting to \nferment so in effect the birds are drinking wine. \nOne instance of drunken flying reports 50 birds flying into \nwindows of a shop near a cherry tree, many of them dying \non impact with the window. There were also reports of wit­\nnesses claiming to have heard the Song Birds singing a \ntune not too unfamiliar to \"The fields of Athenry'' before \nmeeting their maker. The message for birds this migrating \nseason is Don't eat cherries and fly! \nFrench Go Mad over Quiche \nWhen they're not busy causing road blocks and getting \nthemselves into the trouble the French have a love for food \nand drink. Recently French Magazine \"Cuisine et Vins de \nFrance\" have voted the Quiche as their favourite food beat­\ning steak and fries which despite sounding straight out of \nEast Enders was previously number one in France. In cel­\nebration of this or just out of plain piggery a Chef in France \nhas just succeeded in baking the world's largest Quiche. \nChef Alain Marcotullio decided to give a bash a baking the \nworlds largest Quiche. The Quiche is the size of a \"Queen­\nsize bed\" was baked using 1.928 eggs, 156 pounds of \nbacon, 250 pints of milk, 254 pints of sour cream, 134 \npounds of butter and 145 pounds of flour, all this was then \nthrown into a pan that was 16 foot wide. \nThe quiche was eaten by 125 hungry Quiche loving French \nafter the Guinness Book of Records were informed of the \ntremendous feat. Word is that the quiche will appear on \nFrench stamps and currency as a mark of respect for their \nfavourite food! \nC \nTl \ne l \nlo \nis \nre \na l \nw \nCC \n0 \nfc \nfE \ne. \nTt \nSC \nSc \nR« \nSc \nS1 \nd, \np1 \n01 \na \nm \nye \ntE \n01 \nE: \nPi \nG \nB \np \nN \nC \ny \ne \nb",

The Orangutan can now \ncommunicate with humans and is the centre of attention \nfor zoo officials. Officials hope to invest in a $1 million \namphitheatre where children can interact and talk to the \nOrangutan. \nChantek was raised in a trailer by Lynn Miles an \nAnthropologist who treated him like he was human. He was \ntoilet trained and part of his learning incorporated trips to \nMcDonalds as rewards. He can now use sign language to \nexpress approximately 150 words and scientist are hailing \nhim as \"the most exciting exhibit in the world.\" \nOrangutan mania is set to hit Atlanta with merchandising \nand Orangutan gimmicks already being devised, if zoo offi­\ncials are really sharp they may import a few tourism com­\nmittee members from the Fungee town of Dingle, a town \nstill reaping the rewards of a visiting dolphin. \nAmerican press claim Chantek may become next presi­\ndent...stranger things have happened! \nIs a bird? is it a plane? no way! \nit's . .it's .. purple runny stuff? \nLavatory fluid from low flying planes were first been \nblamed for the appearance of purple splotches on homes \nand vehicles in the Rochester area of England. However \nafter police investigation of the said splotches it was con­\ncluded that they had to have come from cherries that had \nmade their way down the digestive highway of passing \nbirds. Locals are sceptical of this however claiming that \nunless the birds had serious health problems or were very \nlarge indeed that it was impossible for them to excrete \nparcels in such sizes. \nTRAHSMITTltlG OK \nBirds eating cherries are also causing problems for people \nin Iowa where drunken flying is a cause for concern for \nmany of the state's bird lovers. It appears that among the \nthousands of song birds migrating each winter, a large por­\ntion stop off in Iowa for refreshments on the journey, a \nnumber of whom partake in the local cherries. However \ndue to early snow a lot of the cherries are on the ground \nmaking easy pickings for the birds, unfortunately or per­\nhaps fortunately for the birds the cherries are starting to \nferment so in effect the birds are drinking wine. \nOne instance of drunken flying reports 50 birds flying into \nwindows of a shop near a cherry tree, many of them dying \non impact with the window. There were also reports of wit­\nnesses claiming to have heard the Song Birds singing a \ntune not too unfamiliar to \"The fields of Athenry'' before \nmeeting their maker. The message for birds this migrating \nseason is Don't eat cherries and fly! \nFrench Go Mad over Quiche \nWhen they're not busy causing road blocks and getting \nthemselves into the trouble the French have a love for food \nand drink. Recently French Magazine \"Cuisine et Vins de \nFrance\" have voted the Quiche as their favourite food beat­\ning steak and fries which despite sounding straight out of \nEast Enders was previously number one in France. In cel­\nebration of this or just out of plain piggery a Chef in France \nhas just succeeded in baking the world's largest Quiche. \nChef Alain Marcotullio decided to give a bash a baking the \nworlds largest Quiche. The Quiche is the size of a \"Queen­\nsize bed\" was baked using 1.928 eggs, 156 pounds of \nbacon, 250 pints of milk, 254 pints of sour cream, 134 \npounds of butter and 145 pounds of flour, all this was then \nthrown into a pan that was 16 foot wide. \nThe quiche was eaten by 125 hungry Quiche loving French \nafter the Guinness Book of Records were informed of the \ntremendous feat. Word is that the quiche will appear on \nFrench stamps and currency as a mark of respect for their \nfavourite food! \nC \nTl \ne l \nlo \nis \nre \na l \nw \nCC \n0 \nfc \nfE \ne. \nTt \nSC \nSc \nR« \nSc \nS1 \nd, \np1 \n01 \na \nm \nye \ntE \n01 \nE: \nPi \nG \nB \np \nN \nC \ny \ne \nb",

The word for Suit is \"Tin of Fruit\" \n, e.g. Oi!

Dustin ofcourse. \nHence forth Dustin the Turkey built himself up as a hard working wise mouthed Turkey for the people. An avid fol­\nlower of political life he has contributed to the political life of the country with campaigns for the Presidency and has \nestablished powerful lobby groups for the rights of turkeys and builders. \nSurprisingly enough the socially conscious Turkey behind the facade has a great sense of Humour and is responsi­\nble for some of the best Derek Davis jokes around he has also made many references to the political manoeuvres of \nMr. John Brutal. \nSo when he's not doing the Television thing what does Dustin do with himself, who is the real Dustin, who is the ' \nTurkey behind the feathers if you like? .... DROP spoke to him on a dodgey mobile phone he was \"minding for a mate . .l \nswear I don't know where it came from but I'll sell it to ya if ya wont .. wah .. wah.wah\". \nHow are things Dustin, we're from DROP magazine in Limerick. \n\"Wah no way Leitrim! ... \" \nNo we're from Limerick \n\"Ah I wos winderin' cos there's no phones in Leitrim wah wah wah \" \nSo Dustin what are you like when not on the TV, what do you get up to? \n\"Well you no da way thay says most famous people or turkeys (wah .. wah) \nare shy types of people behind it all and do work for charities and all \ndat .. well I don't wah wah ... wah, I suppose I keep to me roots like, all \nthis fame hasn't changed me, I mean all the dosh I made hasn't \nchanged me.

Tanx a lot big fella wah wah .\" \nDo you still give a hand at the building then? \n\"Ah yeah of course. Last week I helped the lads get some new furniture \nfor a gaff they're building - I kept Mary busy while they all loaded the \nback of the hiace, I reckon the Aras isn't that nice of a gaff to live \nin now wah wah. Ah no, dat didn't happen at all .... Mary wasn't \ntherell wah wah wah .

I tell the Tax \nman I've no money. Ah no, its all for charity, but don't go checkin' any \naccounts in the Camen Islands wah wah. \non Nlxera as you put It you seem to have a feather stuck In a lot or pies at the \n\"Yo u no how it is, you have to teach some people to do these \nthings roight, ya no.

Ah no, he wanted to do a pantomine w ith a whale in \nit called Moby Dick next year, but I don't know if he wants to \nbe a moby , a Whale, or a Dick - I don't know what a moby is \nbut he could act the other two pretty well wah wah wah . Any \nway the panto has loads of famous people in it but I'm the \nheadline ofcourse. Theres a band called Dove they're brilliant \nbut I reckon they should be called Tu rkey wah wah\" \nApart from your acting, your singing is going very well? \n\" Ah yeah but like I'm good at the ole singing ya know . Last year \nI sold millions so I'm a pro now ya know . Bono and the Boyz \nwe re over to me gaff last year and were askin for tips and stuff \nbut I says \"lads youse no how it is I just opens me beak and \nout it comes I can't teach ya cos its pure natural but youse \naren't doing too bad\" • I told Bono to give Edge a bit more of \nthe singing cos I didn't reckon Bono was the best ya know \nwah wah wah . But the album is going well, I reckoned I'd give \nJoe Dolan a bit of cash ya know hes not doin' the best so I says \nJoe don't wo rry I got the looks and the music we'll make a \nrecord, I gave him a few tips \nya know, constructive criticism like, get a new wig wah wah . \nSo do you have a Christmas message for our readers? \nmoment what between your singing career and recent acting performances In the \"Well I 1. d 1. k \nGaletY where you seem to be going down very well. lk' , suppose I e to say that this Christmas when yer _.1 \nwa 1n \n• ·",

          "text": ".. \nI \nunFringed \nThe Belltable presents a Festival of Fringe Theatre from the 22nd to the \n31st . of January. One of the highlights is the production of Greek by \nDublin based Bedrock Productions. Drop caught up with actress Debbie \nLeeding who plays Doreen and who is a founding member of Bedrock. \nDrop: Could you tell us a little something about the play itself ? \nD.l.: Greek is set in 198o's London. Eddy lives with his Mum and Dad in \na \nrundown area of the city. London itself is ridden with plague and vio­\nlence and Eddy decides to escape this suburban existence. He begins a \nrelationship with \nDoreen ,a waitress ,but his whole life threatens to collapse wh en he \nbrings her \nhome to meet his folks. \nDrop: What can a Limerick audience expect when the play arrives next \nmonth? \nD.L.: The audience may find the language a bit shocking but that it fits \nin well around the scope of the play. It is a very witty piece of work with \na tremendously sexy theatricality about it. I also think that it has a \nunique style which explains how it w as written in imagining a reality \nbeyond the nightmare of Early Eighties London. \nDrop: As a play ,how wa s Greek to w ork on ? \nD.L: It was brilliant to work on. It w as trully difficult not to get emo ­\ntionally \nBallet \n8pm \nVISUAL ART \nCity Gallery of Art, Pery Square (061 310633) \ninvolved in the play itself as the issues involved are so seri­\nous. It's also very passionate and very contemporary ,dealing \nwith the effects of social breakdown and urban decay. \nDrop: How do you think a Limerick audience will react to \nGreek? \nD.l.: I think the Limerick audience will have no problems. \nGreek has very much an urban flavour to it so I think that peo­\nple who have experience of living in the city will understand \nit a little bit better. \nThere are other productions worth checking out during the fes­\ntival at the Belltable : \nThe Little Sisters of Tragedy present SUCKER, a hilarious series \nof perspectives on the messy mechanisms and dirty dealings \ninvolved in the business of celebrity. A girl who dreams of star­\ndom suddenly finds her fantasy becoming Real. So what's the \nproblem ? Is anybody who they seem ? \nThe Corn Exchange present 'A Play On Two Chairs' by Michael \nWest. From the most basic ingredients, namely a man, a \nwoman & two chairs erupts a peculiar world of movement , \nargument and humour. 'A Play On Two Chairs' is a witty, fast \nand surprising piece of physical theatre. \nBrasstacks Theatre Company present 'Nobody's Child' a new \nplay by Alice Barry, it explores a 3-way relationship pointing \nout each person's perceptions of the relationship between a \nyoung emotionally insecure laboratory technician and the cou­\nple she befriends \nDecember-January The GPA Collection of Art \nThe Dolmen Gallery, Honans Quay (061 417929) \nDecember Craft Exhibition \n( Formerly \"Mister Music Man\" O'Connell Mall Limerick) \nThe '75' Gallery, 75 O'Connell St. (061 315650) \nDecember-January Gallery Artists Group Exhibition \nBourne Vincent Gallery, U.L. \n3rd December - 16th January Art of the State \n[Landscapes] \nHunt Museum Gallery \n5th November-23rd January 'Stifle' by Gail Johnston \nBelltable Arts Centre \nDecember Quadrant '97 \nAngela Woulfe Gallery, 16 Pery Square \nExhibition of Oil Paintings by Angela Woulfe \nWE HAVE MOVED I \nTO \nUNIT 1 STEAMBOAT QUAY, LIMERICK. \nStockists of all major brands of \nMusical Instruments and Accessories. \nMonday to Saturday 10am to 6pm",

He can now use sign language to \nexpress approximately 150 words and scientist are hailing \nhim as \"the most exciting exhibit in the world.\" \nOrangutan mania is set to hit Atlanta with merchandising \nand Orangutan gimmicks already being devised, if zoo offi­\ncials are really sharp they may import a few tourism com­\nmittee members from the Fungee town of Dingle, a town \nstill reaping the rewards of a visiting dolphin. \nAmerican press claim Chantek may become next presi­\ndent...stranger things have happened! \nIs a bird? is it a plane? no way! \nit's . .it's .. purple runny stuff? \nLavatory fluid from low flying planes were first been \nblamed for the appearance of purple splotches on homes \nand vehicles in the Rochester area of England. However \nafter police investigation of the said splotches it was con­\ncluded that they had to have come from cherries that had \nmade their way down the digestive highway of passing \nbirds. Locals are sceptical of this however claiming that \nunless the birds had serious health problems or were very \nlarge indeed that it was impossible for them to excrete \nparcels in such sizes. \nTRAHSMITTltlG OK \nBirds eating cherries are also causing problems for people \nin Iowa where drunken flying is a cause for concern for \nmany of the state's bird lovers. It appears that among the \nthousands of song birds migrating each winter, a large por­\ntion stop off in Iowa for refreshments on the journey, a \nnumber of whom partake in the local cherries. However \ndue to early snow a lot of the cherries are on the ground \nmaking easy pickings for the birds, unfortunately or per­\nhaps fortunately for the birds the cherries are starting to \nferment so in effect the birds are drinking wine. \nOne instance of drunken flying reports 50 birds flying into \nwindows of a shop near a cherry tree, many of them dying \non impact with the window. There were also reports of wit­\nnesses claiming to have heard the Song Birds singing a \ntune not too unfamiliar to \"The fields of Athenry'' before \nmeeting their maker. The message for birds this migrating \nseason is Don't eat cherries and fly! \nFrench Go Mad over Quiche \nWhen they're not busy causing road blocks and getting \nthemselves into the trouble the French have a love for food \nand drink. Recently French Magazine \"Cuisine et Vins de \nFrance\" have voted the Quiche as their favourite food beat­\ning steak and fries which despite sounding straight out of \nEast Enders was previously number one in France. In cel­\nebration of this or just out of plain piggery a Chef in France \nhas just succeeded in baking the world's largest Quiche. \nChef Alain Marcotullio decided to give a bash a baking the \nworlds largest Quiche. The Quiche is the size of a \"Queen­\nsize bed\" was baked using 1.928 eggs, 156 pounds of \nbacon, 250 pints of milk, 254 pints of sour cream, 134 \npounds of butter and 145 pounds of flour, all this was then \nthrown into a pan that was 16 foot wide. \nThe quiche was eaten by 125 hungry Quiche loving French \nafter the Guinness Book of Records were informed of the \ntremendous feat. Word is that the quiche will appear on \nFrench stamps and currency as a mark of respect for their \nfavourite food! \nC \nTl \ne l \nlo \nis \nre \na l \nw \nCC \n0 \nfc \nfE \ne. \nTt \nSC \nSc \nR« \nSc \nS1 \nd, \np1 \n01 \na \nm \nye \ntE \n01 \nE: \nPi \nG \nB \np \nN \nC \ny \ne \nb",

It \nwould be well if a few of the disillusions of the \"bar\" \nbusiness weire better known to parents who contemplate­\nsending their children to drunkerics in the city or cou1;1-\ntry. It is du? to t~e ig~ora,nce of pa~·ents to. sen~l their_ \nsons to· .a. busmess, rn wh1ch lihe workrng hours are long \nand slavish and the scale of pay bad . \nThe aver;,rre salary for an assistant may be found be­\ntween the figures of £18 and £25 per annum indoor. \nThis wage· is c,ntirely disproportionate to the lab~ur, an~ : \nto the long business hours. vVe all know _ thaj:. Bung \nopens at 7 a.m. and closes at 11 p.m.-s1xteen hours a \nday! But ~e work of the \"bo,nd slave\" is by no means \nended even then ; for the bar has to be clea.re~ up, shop• \nswept etc. • and I know houses wh ere the assistants, or· \nappre~tices' and assistants,. have to do t.he bottli~g of' \nst<rnt -Of' ale .afte·r closing tune. And then there 1s the \nwork on the Sa1bbath, two till seven, and the \"bona fides\"· \nas well. Out of these one hunclr1:1d and one h,?urs ~r \nwhite slavery per week, how many hours does Bung \no-ive his assistants for recrea,tion ¥ It may come as a sur-­\nprise to the puolic to. know ~hat ~he usual custom, or \nrule is three hours off one mght 111 the week; usually \n8 p.'m. to 11 p.m . It is worth recording this as an in-· \nsta.nce of the generous magnanimity of \"B1;mg.\" \nA young man has absolul;,e!y no op_portumty of better­\ning him self mentally or physically '\\''1th_ three hours only \noil' per week. He ca,nnot attend a Gael ,c L eague class or \nsocial club of a.ny sort. \nAnd the moral aspect of ·the business has a.lso-to be con-· \nsiderecl. Because a public-house is a public-hou~e; it is. \nin it .a.Jl sorts of petty sca,uda,ls are openly discussed,. \na,nd coM-se jes-ts and \"tips\" bantered freely a.bout,. 1.,o,. \nthe complete demor alisa.tion of the· young fellows behmd \nthe bar. \nOf course, I do not mean it to• be uu de,rstood that all \nthe grieva.nces I speak of exist in all the liceured houses. \nin tbe trade. On the contr.a.ry, there are houses that \na-re well kept, a.ud where the assista.nts ru·e ,;vell and_ \ndecently treated. These ·houses though, are few and \nfal· between;\" they do not, I fea,r, compose one-fom·th \nof !Jhe licensed houses in the coru11.,ry. And wha ,t pros­\npects has a young ma .n entering this business, with its: \nbad pay, ha.cl housing, and long hours. Does \" Bung \" \nusually bring up his children to the trade? Not he. \nHe ma ,kes professional men of them, or tries to·. \nNow th,at the \"Shop-Hours Act\" is extending itself \nto this country, it is the duty of the \"Bond Sla.ves of \nBung\" to get the voice of public opinion to put an end \nto the long hours tha.t exist in public houses. \nA CoUNTEY SnoP-IrnEPE4'. \nTh RINK EARLSFORT TERRACE, \n~·e -::1; .L Thmsday, 6ill April, at 7.30 p.m .. \nGrand Ban1d Promenade f/ Concert \nIn connection with Lhe forthcoming St. Vincent de Paul Bazaar. \nPUBLIC SKATING!

O 'Reilly, Phoonix Ba -r. \nReferring to the publica,ns a.11d St. Pa.trick's Day , \nou~· coutempora,ry <the L einster L eacler says: - \"Lt is our \npamful .task to rema.rk that, uotwitJhstanding the noble \nefforts of our Bishops a,nd priests, as well as of the Gaelic \nLeague, to ha,ve the Na.tiona.J Festiva.l observed in a \nrevere.ntiaJ a,nd seolf-respecting. mam1e1·, it was only too \napparent in ma.ny pa,rts o.f frela.nd tha,t tihe \"back doors'' \nof a la.rge numb er of the public-houses admitted flocks \nof men a.nd women who could .not resist the strong temp­\ntat,ion thus a.tfo1'ded for drowning the Shamrock. We \nmust say .that the publicans who promised to close their \nesta,blishm ents for the day, and who put up their \nshutters, while a,t the same time their doors were aja.r to \nadmit all comers, were guilty of very reprehensible a.nd \nretrogressive co-nduct.\" And a,ga,iJ1 :-\"The pitiruble and \nohjectfonable spectacle of men a,ncl-we reg.retJ to say \nit-women -too, staggering out -0f \"closed\" public-ho-uses, \nmet the gaze in many quarters; and the poor tradesmen \naiid their wives were afforded the opportunity -0.f spend­\ning on maddening liquor the money which was sorely \nneedled for .the do'thing and m ai,ntena.noe o.f their \nunfortiunate children.\" The publicans who opened, aind \nthose who did a \"back door\" trade on St. Pat1rick's Day , \nno doubt, by sponging on St. Pa.trick, put extra mon~y \nin their tills, but ultima,tely they will find, we believe, \nthat they !have only strengthened the volume of -0pinion \nthat is shocked at the na,tion-ruiners who soak upwards \nof £14,000,000 per annum from this poor coun,try. As \nna,tion-killers, what are tihe la,ndlords now to the• \nBungs1 • \nFather Murphy, M.S., the energetic Irish Ireland \npriest of Ennisco·rthy delive,red a lecture in the Town \nHall Loughrea, reoontly, under the auspices of the local \nTotal Abstinence Society. His Lordship ·the Most Rev. \nDr. O'Dea, presided, .and in putting the vote of thanks \nto the lecturer, said, according to .a ;report in a local \npaper : -\"Dealing with .the drink evil 1his Lordship ~aid \nthat the annual drink bill for Ireland was 14 milhons \nof money, and seeing some time ·ago some statistics \nquoted by the Bishop of LimeQ-ick as to :the amount of \nmoney spent in that city for drink, i:t struck him th?'t \nit would be interesting to find out the amount spent m \nhis own cathed,ral town. F11'0_m <la.ta supplied by a \nfi-iend he found .that for the, months of December, \n,January, and February last, they had spenti for porter \nalone, £2,900'-0r pra.ctica,lly £3,000. He did not by \na,ny means, however, say that this amount was spent in \nthe town alone. '.Dhe sum mentioned repre~nted the \namount expended in a district embracing something like \na, radius of 6 or 7 miles. If tJhe months of Deoombeir, \n,January, and February mig,ht be taken ru. a f.air aver­\naO'e, the a,nnua.l amount spent on porter :in th.a.t dis·trict \nw\n0\nas £11 600. Their whiskey bill a.dded 'to that brought \nthe tota'.1 up to a;bout £18,000·. Now, if instead of \nspending that money on drink they handed it ov_er to \nhis Lordship, he would in the first yel!,,r esta.bhsh .a \nbacon factory, in tJhe &~cond yea.r a. wooillen faotory, ~nd \nin .the third year •he would complele the Cathedral.\" \n''The question of the. attendance of workhouse children: \nat public outside schools is .an important one. W,e _dO' \nnot think that anyone with a clear head and a Ohnstian: \n•hea.rt would disagree with the proposition that .every­\nchi'ld who has the misfortune to be in a, workhpuse ought \nto receive his education amongst the boys, and girls in \nthe country's schools who have the fortune ~ be o~tside \nthe workhouse. !tis not the fault of poor little children \nthat they are in the workhouse, and the unf<?1-tuna~ lot \nto which they are born ought, from every pomt of view, \nand pa,rticularly from the Christian point of vie~, be \nma.de as light ,and hopeful as possible. The practice of \nsending workhouse children to outside schools is fairly \ncommon, .and we think that every right,.thinking man · \nwould wish it to be uuive,rsal. Reoontly there was a re­\nactionary motion to withdraw certain workhouse children \nfrom t11e convent schools, and revert to the, old system of' \nhaving a, house teacher appointed. Monsignor Ha.JJi­\nnau, P.P., of Newcas~le West , happily threw in his \nweight against this reactiona-ry proposal, and so· the chil­\nclro'n a,re still being sent to the convent schools. As Mon­\nsignor Hallinan, in a• letter to, -0110 of the Gu ardians,, \nsa.id : -\" E.verybody who has a thought or a desire for \nthe welfare of these little children, and practical know­\nledge of a workhouse .and its surroundings, must feel tha,t \nit is .a blessing to them to be taken away as much as pos­\nsible from its prison-like, depressing and demoralising· \na.t.mo spheres, a-nd have them brought out into the open \na.nd info contact with other children. Hence it was only \nnatural that you , as their Guardians, whose primary con­\ncern is their ma.reria.l and moral well-being, should take \nthat step. You are not, however, the first Board of' \nGu ardia.us in Ireland -t.hat has done so. I wish you were, \nand ha.cl done so years a.go, for no•thing but credit is due \nto those Guardians who initiated this progressive policy.\" \nVire hope that Monsignor Ha.llinan's prediction ·wilJ come \ntrue thair-\" For myself I a.m convinced that within a; \ndozen years you will have very few unions in Ireland \nkeeping on the old system, which is self-condemned, and \nought to be discarded as soon as possible everywhere.\" \nvVe a.re glad to be able to a.nnounce tha,t the Munster . \nFeis, 1905, will be held on the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and \n10th of Augu st next. On the opening day, Sunday , \nthere will be a band promenade , a.t which one of the most \ncelebrated of om· South of Ireland ba.nds will be asked \nto, perform. Music of a distinctly Irish character, in­\ncluding the best productions of our modern Irish com­\nposers, will be rendered. On Monday, the 7th August, \nthe Munster Conference will be held. Even at this early \ndate motions to be brought forward at this conference \nwill be accepted and filed, a.nd it is to be hoped that by \nthe middle of next July a, goodly number will be oII \nJta.nds for the printer. On Tuesday and Wednesday \nthere will be the Competitions, and, from what we ha.ve \nseen of the syllabus, it will not be the fault of the Com­\nmittee if they do not a.ttraiot crowds of competitors from \nevery paJ-t of Munster.. A Grand Turus will be !held OII \nThursday, the 10th August, and opportunities for a, \ncheap and enjoyable trip will be placed .at the disposal of \n.all Gaelic League visitors. Munster Gaels are invited \nto consider the feasibility of making a, portion of their \nsummer ·holidays coincide with the Munster Feis week \nnext August in Killa.rney. \nBelfast is often held u11 as a, sort o.f model to Ireland. \nThere was .a.n a.ct.ion recently fa-ied in the Cotu·ts there \nbefore Mr. Justice Kenny, Mid his Lordship, addressing· \nLhe Jury, sa.id :-'' He had to confess .tha.t in the pre­\nsent case, having regard to the number of witnesses \nexamined on each side, a.nd the point-blank assertions \non the one· side tihat were denied upon the othe1<, he \nfelt the greatest clifficult,y in conveying to t'he jury what \nthe indica,tion o-f his miud was-if his mind was made \nup a,t .a.H-he meant as a judge o.f fact.

I wish you were, \nand ha.cl done so years a.go, for no•thing but credit is due \nto those Guardians who initiated this progressive policy.\" \nVire hope that Monsignor Ha.llinan's prediction ·wilJ come \ntrue thair-\" For myself I a.m convinced that within a; \ndozen years you will have very few unions in Ireland \nkeeping on the old system, which is self-condemned, and \nought to be discarded as soon as possible everywhere.\" \nvVe a.re glad to be able to a.nnounce tha,t the Munster . \nFeis, 1905, will be held on the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and \n10th of Augu st next. On the opening day, Sunday , \nthere will be a band promenade , a.t which one of the most \ncelebrated of om· South of Ireland ba.nds will be asked \nto, perform. Music of a distinctly Irish character, in­\ncluding the best productions of our modern Irish com­\nposers, will be rendered. On Monday, the 7th August, \nthe Munster Conference will be held. Even at this early \ndate motions to be brought forward at this conference \nwill be accepted and filed, a.nd it is to be hoped that by \nthe middle of next July a, goodly number will be oII \nJta.nds for the printer. On Tuesday and Wednesday \nthere will be the Competitions, and, from what we ha.ve \nseen of the syllabus, it will not be the fault of the Com­\nmittee if they do not a.ttraiot crowds of competitors from \nevery paJ-t of Munster.. A Grand Turus will be !held OII \nThursday, the 10th August, and opportunities for a, \ncheap and enjoyable trip will be placed .at the disposal of \n.all Gaelic League visitors. Munster Gaels are invited \nto consider the feasibility of making a, portion of their \nsummer ·holidays coincide with the Munster Feis week \nnext August in Killa.rney. \nBelfast is often held u11 as a, sort o.f model to Ireland. \nThere was .a.n a.ct.ion recently fa-ied in the Cotu·ts there \nbefore Mr. Justice Kenny, Mid his Lordship, addressing· \nLhe Jury, sa.id :-'' He had to confess .tha.t in the pre­\nsent case, having regard to the number of witnesses \nexamined on each side, a.nd the point-blank assertions \non the one· side tihat were denied upon the othe1<, he \nfelt the greatest clifficult,y in conveying to t'he jury what \nthe indica,tion o-f his miud was-if his mind was made \nup a,t .a.H-he meant as a judge o.f fact. Five witnesses \nfor plaintiff, and six for defendants, had point-blank \ncle.niecl wha,t was asserted iby each side. He -had 'l.\"a.roly \nti-ied a case, though -he 11ad tried a fair number in Bel­\nfast a.nd also in Dublin, w!here there was su<ih cont.ra.­\ndictory evidence.

Roberts and \nMulroney hove been _ friends for years ( \"laughed \nand cried\", you know the score) who years bock \nvowed. as you do. to marry each other if neither hod \nfound a partner for life before their twenty-eight \nbirthdays. Hunkey-dory, dandy-a until Mulroney rings \nwith the news that \"'Ta-Do!\" he's fallen in lurve (with \nCameron Diaz; who hasn't?) and is tying the knot in \na couple of days (Americans really aren't into long \nengagements , ore they?) Cue Roberts· realisation \nthat, shock, horror. she's really loved Mulroney all this \ntime and now must endeavour to break up the \nengagement in an attempt to get her heart's \ndesire. And that's basically it. Simple it may be but \nit's played to the hilt with Roberts on top form con­\nfirming herself as probably Hollywood's best roman­\ntic comedy actress, deliciously vindictive In her \nattempts to trip up Diaz (check out the \"karaoke\" \nscene) who despite her very preppy appearance is \nsimply ·so' nice you can't help loving her to bits ( I \ndidn't). Mulroney plays it relatively straight and firm­\njawed but the real kudos go to Everett as Roberts· \ngay best friend who Is constantly on hand dooling \nout advice and trying to keep her on the stral~ht \nand narrow, a pillow for her hurt feelings as the slow \nrealisation of truth dawns . \"My Best Friend's \nWedding\" Is light good-humoured fun and like your \nfavourite stuffed toy, It's soft, cudqly and fluffy but \nwithout that much between Its ears. \nAIR FORCE ONE (15) \nDir: Wolfgang Peterson \nStarring: Harrison Ford. Gory Oldman. Glen Close \nReleased: 1 7-3-98 \n\"And now , for something completely differ­\nent .... \" Described by the king of outsized, \nleather armchair criticism . Barry Norman. as \"the \nmost enjoyable blockbuster of the year\" this high­\naltitude. high-octane Presidential action fest is a \ndead cert to have all the Yanks in the audience on \ntheir feet and cheering as Ford saves the world \n(again). This is the role he was born to play (and \nprobably the man Slick Willy wishes he was) and \nplay it he does with appropriate steely-eyed integri­\nty and gritty. principled posturing. Set aboard the \nPresidential 747, A ir Force One . we find the first fam­\nily held hostage by Gory O ldman led Russian \nextremists for the release of their recently incarcer­\nated leader. And that's all you need to know i.e. if \nyou've seen \"Passenger 57\". \"Executive Decisidn\" or. \nfor that ma tter. anything to do with planes. serious \nweaponry and a star who costs so much to put in a \nfilm you know he's not going to get killed, you'll \nknow where this one is headed from the off. \nPeterson who has already delved into things presi­\ndential with the superior \"In the Line of Fire\" cap­\ntures the claustrophobic feeling of entrapment with­\nin the plane's exterior excellently (a la \"Das Boot\") \nand moves the action along nicely. Oldman is in \ntop. fruitcake form (he's in danger of becoming heir \nto Dennis Hopper 's crown if he continues at this rate. \nOn a bit of a tangent if you get a chance check out \nOldman ·s s~unning directorial debut \"Nil By Mouth.\") \nand Close impresses as the emotionally torn V.P.This \nIs fairly predictable but highly entertaining fore and \nthe perfect accompaniment to a soft couch. a six­\npack and a coffee table of munchies.",

          "raw_text": "LIMERICK EVENTS GUIDE \n}Vlusic \nSOUPED UP MUSIC \nFACT : the Lads from 'Soup Fiction' \nViewed from the wings of contemp orary mu sic, it ma y seem like halcyon days for Lim erick band, \nSOUP FICTION . A s w inners of the Limerick EXPO Show case '93 which prom pted debut C D E P \n'Begn,dge' and an admirable am ount of RTE airplay, regular players on the Th eatre Royal stage \nincluding support to Del Amitri and Mar y C oughlan, and now as regional finalists in the HOT \nPRESS/Bacardi Unplugged Band Competition, (taking place in the Student Bar UC C o n \nTuesday 31 January) it ma y seem that SOUP FICTION are flooring firm founJation~ for \nrock/pop perpetuity. And ma ybe they are.Yet according lo Yvo nne Ma cMa hon, band vocalist \nalong with singer/songwriter sister, Fiona, lliillling guarantees a sure standing on the accepted \ncrest of contemp orary rock. \n\"Winning Showca se '93 was very good for us in that it gor us into the stud io tut it seem ed a lot \nof people just assumed that w inning a big competition like that wo uld bring ove rnight succe~s. \nUnfortunately it doesn't work like that. Sh owca se '93 wa s just a step. It did he-Ip as we we re able \nto use the weight of it to pu~h us into RTE and that w1s imp ortant to us but making it in music \nis very, very tough. lt's a long road/ she claims, \"but w e're still on it.\" \nOne of the main problems faced by stmggling bands in Lim erick these da ys, believes Yv onne. is \nthe lack of regul~r venue s available to mu sicians eager to prom ote original ma terial. \n\"You have the Theatre Ro yal - and the Savoy put on a few gigs too -but there is a serious need \nfor more venues for live, original mu sic. True, there's mu sic in most of the city's pubs nightly, but \nthe majority of them insist on cover band s only. Lim erick used to be very w ell know fm it's live \ngigs and it's a shame that there's very few places for those gigs now . Especially as there 1s still an \nawful lot of origina•l bands around wh o just can not get_ the exposure needed .\".-\n1n an effort to ease the problem , Yvo nne and Fiona did start up a Songvvriters C lub last A ugust \nin the Theatre Club, Catherine Street, prom pting a platform for solo art1Sts. Sloppmg over the \nChristmas period, both hope to kick off again com e February. _ _ \nA s for the band itself, 1995 does loo k prom ising. Starting it off with the H O T PR ESS /Bacard t \nUnplu gged Band C omp etitiorr (w hich, incidentally, includes a group line-up of Paul H ealy on \nguitar instead of regular group guitarist D es O 'D wye r, Barry D onnelly on percussion taking the \nplace of Tony Brennan and Mick Hoga n, Paul Harrison, Fiona and Yv onne), the band also plan to \nreturn to the studio mid -spring. W ith app roxim ately 10 songs already penned, a second EP seem s \nimmin ent. \n\"W e're happy that these are the songs that w e wa nt to wo rk w ith,\" claims Yvo nne, \"though how \nman y of them wi ll tum up on the new recording, I don't know . W e've been ~aving ~ver the last \nfew m onths so that we . could have the m oney to do this stud io w ork and w e re lookmg forwa rd \nto it.

My review is in the post. Goodnight !\" \n:'FORGET ALL THAT!\" she'bellowed, \"We have a job for you tonight. I want you to go undercov­\ner to Docs niteclub tonight and get us the inside story on the line-dancing craze.\" \nEm ... Ex-squeeze-me ?! Line-dancing ?! Country Music? All night? Well, that sounds like gobs of \nfun, no thank you very much ........ . \n(8.00pm Mo11day Eve11i11g) Stetson hat, shades, blue jeans, denim shirt and a hideous (a!'ld I mean \nHI DEOUS) pair of cow boy boo ts donned, 1 make m y first tentative steps onto the dancefloor to learn \nthe Flying Eight. W ith a cast of hun d reds wh o turn up -religiously-every Monday night, I'm begin­\nning to get the hang of it. Th ere's actually a great atm osphere of fun in the place. Everyone is really \nfriendly -nothing like the tense poseur, m ating gam e practised in m ost nightclubs -but it's hard going \nat times, wo rks up a thirst and all that( ... Whi ch remind s me ... \" O i ! Wh ere's m y Bud '? Put it on the \nL.E.C. accoun t .. !\") \nWh en the dancefloor fills and everyone is dancing in unison, it is quite a thrill. The music is up-tempo \nand cheery, nothing to do with the \"Lost m y w oman , spilled m y beer\" type of moaning that I normally \nassociate with country mu sic. 1n fact, I'll admit it (and you can slag me off all you want) but Line \nDa ncing is fun. I had a great time. I'd even go there again (though ma ybe next time, minus the cow­\nboy boots). \nHoward and G eraldine Dee are the du o behind the fun at D oc's. C o-prod ucers of the Step-in-Line \nRoad show , they've taught people all over the country to really Slap Leather. H owa rd him self is no \nstranger to Co untry Mu sic. Regularly contributing to In Du b/111 magazine and Co 1111try M usic \nI11ternalio11a/, he has a grea·l love and an extensive know ledge of the sounds that lead the crowd at \nDoc 's thru the m any varied line dances every week. Regular trips to Nashville keep him up to date on \nw hat's happ ening on the otherside of the A tlantic and it w as actually there that H oward and \nGe raldine first go t the idea to assembl e a troupe of professional dancers to bring it all home to the \nIrish. \nTh ey explained, \"W e figured that people down the coun try w ould be into w hat city folk we re doing \nin places like Break/or the Border. Line dancing does not require a partner and it's non-threatening: It's \nsom ething that people of all ages can have fun with. One lady, in her fifties and recently widowe d, told \nme that line-dancing every W edn esday in Dublin has changed her life. She now lives for her \nW ed nesday nigh t out and wh en her friends call around -instead of sitting around d rinkin& too much \ncoffee - they practise their dances, stepping to the 'Tushbush' right there in her kitchen !\" \nW ith over 360 different line dances to learn, from the relatively straight forwa rd Electric Slide or the \nFlying Eight to the speedy and very technical Tushbush, it is imp erative that those serious about good \ndancing technique are guided by professional tutors. Since the phenom enon took off iri this country, \nthe Step-in-Line team (wh o have three troupes putting on hows nationwide) have noticed that som e \npeople w ho have attended their classes, even for a short while, are currently running line-dancing \nnights -offering to give 'professional' instniction and turning a tidy little profit in the process. T he fact \nthat each of the man y line dances are copyrighted and that it is illegal for anyone other that qualified \nprofessionals who have copyright, to teach the step_s, does not deter the 'cowb oys' from d oing it them­\nselve how ever. \n\"T here is very little w e can do about this,\" says H ow ard, \n\"but w hen you are taught by our professionals at \nStep-in-Line, you learn each dance properly and \nthis m eans that you can join in any dances \nyou know anywh ere the dancing is going \non, w hether it be Na shville, ew York or \nNe w castlew est !\" \nSound s good to m e.

The frustration of the gathered mass of supp orters was evident. \nLimerick dominated and attacked well for an hour but when you r luck is out \n- it's ou t and Limerick's was out to lunch. In that hour Lime rick saw goal­\nbound efforts clip the uprights, get scrambled off the goal-line by flailing \nDrogheda defenders and both Dnit/r( McMn/r on and Howie King blazed over \nthe crossbar when the back of the net looked ready to burst. \nJust after the hour Drogheda pushed forward far enough to force a corner \n(their first real scoring oppo rtunity of the game.) A Drogheda header m et the \ncross first and it was Limerick F.C. 0 - Drogheda l. Four minutes later \nDrogheda had their second and last chance of the game : Another corner, \nanother header .... Limerick F.C. 0 - Drogheda 2. I was disgusted. The flukie \npoxy bastards ! (I guess I was a bit biased as well.) \nAfter that Limericks heads dropped for a bit and though they renewed their \nattacks in the last 20 minutes, it was fruitless. Drogheda locked up shop and \nthe game and points were lost. There were, however, some positive points -\nnotably individual performances by Anthony Toibin and Howie King. Howie \nin particular seemed to grow in confidence as the game developed ... and \nhere's one to ponder : The louder the people cheered hi~ on, the better and \nm ore determined he became. Old formula but there you have it : get up to \nHogan Park and cheer Howie on - that lad'll come good for us yet \nI've just heard on the wireless that Man.

Should they triumph, the plan 1s 'Goal King Cole' \nwhich will help them shake their \"Rochdale of Europe\" tag. There's a long \nway to go in the premiership yet but it has to.be said that Blackbum Rovers \nare looking good.

          "text": "+ Ruby Mundy \nmundy I dolans warehouse I may 23 \n~ \ncoming from birr, county offaly is not generally acknowledged \nas an indicator of international stardom. but taking his very \nfirst steps from that stalwart of hurling, m u n d y \nhas played and had his music played all over the world. fresh \nfrom the release of his new album, '24 star hotel', he's on a \nsprint around the country to satisfy the ever growing demand \nfor his live shows. LEG checks in ..... \nBorn Edmund Enright to publican parents, Mundy dis­\ncovered guitars at the age of fourteen, bought a cou­\nple of books and taught himself how to play. He wrote \nsongs to kill time while serving behind his folk's bar \nand within six months started playing his own gigs. \nBirr's amenities (36 pubs and one record shop) gave the \nyoung Mundy the motivation to move to Dublin, where he \npaid his dues as a street busker before a two-song demo led \nto a publishing deal with Warner Chappell, followed by an \nSony recording contract. In early 1996, he released the \nthree-track 'LMNEP' followed by his hugely successful single \n'To You I Bestow'. On only his sixth live gig, Mundy found \nhimself opening on Alanis Morrisette's first UK tour. \nMundy's debut album, 'Jellylegs', was released in late '96 \non Epic (Sony) to widespread critical and public acclaim and \nled to a hectic two year schedule of promotion and touring. \nThe inclusion of his track 'To You I Bestow' in the film and \nsoundtrack of Baz Luhrmans' Romeo and Juliet, which went \non to sell 11 million copies, further enhanced Mundys' repu­\ntation and ensured that his already hectic schedule became \neven busier. This amazing rollercoaster of activity saw him \nplay live almost continually, supporting a huge array of \nartists including Neil Young, Cast, The Longpigs, Manic Street \nPreachers, Mansun and Van Morrison to name but a few. His \nschedule saw him perform at some of the most high profile \nmusic festivals in Europe and the USA. \nTime out for the then 23-year-old Mundy was never a \nproblem, but it became a necessity in order to resume writ-\ning and get the creative juices flowing again. And flow they did. \nIt wasn't long before he was ready to demo tracks for his sec­\nond album which he recorded with Tommy D (Catatonia, Finlay \nQuaye, Shack, Geneva) in October '99. \nMundy parted company with Sony early last year and in March \nwent back into the studio with a number of new songs, fresh \nideas and stacks of enthusiasm, this time working with Andrew \nPhillpott, well known for his programming work with U2 and \nDepeche Mode. The resulting EP, 'The Moon Is A Bullet Hole' is \nMundy at his very best, proving that the time taken out to travel \nand write was indeed time well spent. It also rounded off what \nhad been an exceptional year for the Offaly man, leading to \nnumerous TV appearances on RTE, Network 2, BBC, TV3 and \nTG4 as well as a promotional tour of radio stations the length \nand breadth of the country. His sell-out Irish tour followed and \nsaw him play to capacity crowds all over Ireland. In November, \nMundy's UK tour took him to all of the major British cities \nincluding Manchester, York, Bristol, Liverpool, Birmingham, \nGlasgow, Edinburgh and London. \nThe start of the year had Mundy on the road again and an \ninvite to SXSW in Austin Texas which led on to dates in San \nFran/Boston/Chicago & New York. \nFans who flocked to see Mundy at his Irish live performances \nduring the summer already knew what to expect, and those who \nhad missed him previously were in for a real treat! The good \nnews is that it didn't stop there, as plans were already in place \nfor a second release in the summer, followed by a new album \nlater on in the year. \nDue to the success of his recent Irish tours, Mundy was once \nagain on the road to see the fans that were unable to get tickets \nfor his pre Christmas shows. Tickets were so scarce for his \nDublin and Cork shows in September and October, that Cork \nfans queued in the rain for over two hours and Whelan's were \nforced to turn away over 300 people. The attendance for that \nshow was the second largest ever recorded at the famous Dublin \nvenue. \nHis new album, '24 Star Hotel', has just been released , with \nthe first single (a double A side of two new live favourites, 'July' \nand 'Mexico'), set for release on June 15th. The record was first \nrecorded in the summer of 1999, and initially titled '22 Star \nHotel'. the change came after the record had spent two years in \nMundy's beside locker befor~ he decided to release it, saying on \nit's sleeve that he felt it would be \"a sin to hide my progression. \nin music, my life really\", and already promising stories of what \nhas happened since on his next record. \nOther projects he has been involved with include a recording \nwith award winning drum and bass act, Bass Odyssey, which is \nto appear on the forthcoming Chernobyl Children's Project bene­\nfit album. He has just completed a·us tour and returned home \nto support The Frames at their Heineken Green Energy gig in \nDublin Castle over the May bank holiday weekend. He now \nembarks on a national tour for the month of June. \nMundy's star is once again on the rise, as you can find out for \nyourself on thursday, may 23 in dolan's warehouse. \ndon't be late. \nwin two tickets to mundy In the warehouse on may 23. \nmall the correct answer to the following question to comps(1)elghtball.le; \n\"what was the name of mundy's first record?•",

His lordship, who possesses the \nnerve and bearing characteristic of an experienced \nwarrior, was almost unnerved by the intensity of \nthe welcome and admiration which men, women, \nand children expressed with such enthusiasm at his \nappearance. He paused an instant with gratifica­\ntion upon the exciting spectacle before him, and \nthen. gave himself over to the embraces of his old \nfriends and for111er companions in arms, including \nGenerals Bourke and Napier.

Since last addressed by \nthis Corporation, it were needless for me, my Lord, \nto recount the many glorious victories you have \nachieved-it were needless for me to speak of the \nmany labours and dangers which, with Herculean \ncourage, you have undergone; suffice it for me to \nsay, that with feelings of the highest respect and \nadmiration-with feelings of the warmest affection \nand kindness do the inhabitants and Corporation of \nLimerick welcome you to-day.

His lordship, who possesses the \nnerve and bearing characteristic of an experienced \nwarrior, was almost unnerved by the intensity of \nthe welcome and admiration which men, women, \nand children expressed with such enthusiasm at his \nappearance. He paused an instant with gratifica­\ntion upon the exciting spectacle before him, and \nthen. gave himself over to the embraces of his old \nfriends and for111er companions in arms, including \nGenerals Bourke and Napier. Lord Gough was \naccompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Gough , Captain \nthe Hon. G. S. Gough , George Gough, Esq., Ben­\njamin Frend, Esq,, Benjamin Frend, junr., Esq., \nand Lieutenant-Colonel Doyle, who received him at \nthe junction. \nSo anxious were all to catch a glimpse of the \nnoble and venerable warrior that it was with diffi. • \nculty he gained access through the crowd to the \nplatform, and on being then fully recognised the \nband struck up \"See the conquering tfero comes,\" \naccompanied by rapturous cheering from the dense \nmultitude. His lordship, who looked hale and \nvigorous, though m _arked with the snows of time, \nwas attired in a dark frock coat and trowsers, with \na plain star on his breast. \nThe Mayor, who was in the first instance most \ncordially recognised by the distinguished hero, \nhaving introduced the members of council to Lord \nGough, and his lordship having repeatedly bowed \nin acknowledgment of the congratulations he re­\nceived, the Corporation ascended the elevated posi­\ntion where the address was to be presented. \nThe Mayor then said, my Lord- I beg to re-\n• \n~PPENbIX,-:-<NO.

His lordship, who possesses the \nnerve and bearing characteristic of an experienced \nwarrior, was almost unnerved by the intensity of \nthe welcome and admiration which men, women, \nand children expressed with such enthusiasm at his \nappearance. He paused an instant with gratifica­\ntion upon the exciting spectacle before him, and \nthen. gave himself over to the embraces of his old \nfriends and for111er companions in arms, including \nGenerals Bourke and Napier. Lord Gough was \naccompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Gough , Captain \nthe Hon. G. S. Gough , George Gough, Esq., Ben­\njamin Frend, Esq,, Benjamin Frend, junr., Esq., \nand Lieutenant-Colonel Doyle, who received him at \nthe junction. \nSo anxious were all to catch a glimpse of the \nnoble and venerable warrior that it was with diffi. • \nculty he gained access through the crowd to the \nplatform, and on being then fully recognised the \nband struck up \"See the conquering tfero comes,\" \naccompanied by rapturous cheering from the dense \nmultitude. His lordship, who looked hale and \nvigorous, though m _arked with the snows of time, \nwas attired in a dark frock coat and trowsers, with \na plain star on his breast. \nThe Mayor, who was in the first instance most \ncordially recognised by the distinguished hero, \nhaving introduced the members of council to Lord \nGough, and his lordship having repeatedly bowed \nin acknowledgment of the congratulations he re­\nceived, the Corporation ascended the elevated posi­\ntion where the address was to be presented. \nThe Mayor then said, my Lord- I beg to re-\n• \n~PPENbIX,-:-<NO. I; 77· \nceive you with a cordial cead mille failtha. On \nbehalf of the citizens and Corporation of Limerick, \npermit me to give you a nght hearty welcome on \nyour arrival in your native city. Intimately con­\nnected with us as you are by family ties, believe that \nby none wa _s your brilliant career more anxiously \nwatched-believe that by none were your splendid \ntriumphs more appreciated than by the people of \nthis good olq city, who now feel that the renown \nfor bravery and military prowess, which has long \nrendered their city immortal, will receive a large ad­\ndition by having the name of Limerick associated \nwith that of yours, by having it recorded that this \nwas the birth-place of the Gallant Gough (hear). \nMy Lord, it becomes my pleasing duty, on this oc­\ncasion, to present you with an address from the \nCorporation of this ancient city, unanimously \nadopted by them (hear) and expressive of their plea­\nsure and pride at seeing you once again amongst \nthem, strong in health, and distinguished by \nhonorable fame (cheers). Since last addressed by \nthis Corporation, it were needless for me, my Lord, \nto recount the many glorious victories you have \nachieved-it were needless for me to speak of the \nmany labours and dangers which, with Herculean \ncourage, you have undergone; suffice it for me to \nsay, that with feelings of the highest respect and \nadmiration-with feelings of the warmest affection \nand kindness do the inhabitants and Corporation of \nLimerick welcome you to-day. And, my Lord, to \nbe the medium ofconveying those, the sentiments \nof my fellow-citizens, to your Lordship, in which, \nwith heart and soul I join, believe me I must ever \nesteem it as a high and distinguished honor. I \nshall now, my Lord, with your permission, read the \naddress to your Lordship, which was adopted with \nacclamation at the last meeting of the Corporation \nof this city (hear).",

These rude stone piers were made by \nencasing stones in wicker ,vork, and the hurdles ,vere attached to timber \nstrt:tchers, generally of bog oak, from pier to pier. Another kind of \nbridge, frequently to be found in mountain districts, ,vas the \"clapper\" \nbridge. The piers were usually formed of large and heavy sfonos and \nthe transverse stone slabs were generally from nine to twelve feet in \nlen,,rth. These were our first stone bridges, and are still occasionally to \nbe found across mountain streams. The next development was the \n,vooden, or plank bridge, of which we find mention in our ancient record. \nNo\\V the question suggests itself, how was the Shannon bridged between \n\"the island city\" and Thomond in pre-Norman times? There can be \nlittle doubt that it was bridged. The Cantilever hurdle bridge was out \nof the question, and the hurdle bridge on piles was not possible owing \nto rhe rocl'Y river bed.",

The date of the construction of the bridge is usually \nassigned to the year 1210. Son1e engineering critics of the early part of \nthe last century held the opinion that the bridge then constructed was \nmerely a ,vooden one, and that the stone bridge t:iken do\\vn in I840 \nwas a structure of a later date, probably of the I 5th or even r6th \ncentury. \nIf the castle erected by John was only bretesclze, i.e., a wooden tower, \nsuch as the Normans frequently erected both in England and Ireland in \nthe 11th and 12th centuries; this theory might hold good, but the \nadjective egregitt1n ,vould not apply to such a temporary structure, and \nboth tradition and the 1\\nnals are in agreement that King John C:astle \nwas built of stone. The old 'foundations are still to be seen on which \nthe present towers have been built. If the castle was built of stone, \n' w hy not the bridge? and as our Annals do not v:iention the erection ofa \nstone bridge across the Shannon afterwards, we may fairly assume that \ntradition and the Annals are accurate, and the old Thomond Bridge \nwas the stone bridge constructed in the early years of the thirteenth \ncentury. This bridge, then, was a fine example of the good and \npermanent ,vork done by early Anglo-Norman bridge builders.

The \nengraving of this bridge in Lenihan's History (p. 50) is clearly idealistic \nand inaccurate. All goods coming over this bridge into the city were \nsubject to tolls. The money thus collected went to keep the br\\dge in \nrepair.

Many mementoes of the slaughter of \nsome six hundred of the garrison of .Limerick on the old bridge were \nthen found. This fatal occurence took place on the 22nd September, \n169r, ,vhen the English, having taken the .putworks protecting the \nbridge, drove the defenders on to the bridge, when a French major, who \nwas in command at Thomond Gate, raised the dra,vbridge, and the Irish \nwere driven into the Shannon !nd drowned, or slaughtered on the bridge. \nThis terrible slaughter of their comrades, under the eyes of the garrison, \nwho ,ve1e powerless to render assistance or succour them, tended 1nainly \nto a parley for the surrender of the city next day, and the Treaty of \nLitnerick. \nA considerable amount of James II. brass money was found in the \nbed of the river, near the centre arch, the site of the drawbridge.",

The houses were of brick, three storeys \nhigh, only one room in breadth, and overhung the river at the rear. \nA charter ,vas granted in 1340 for the building of a bridge in \nLimerick. As Baals Bridge was the only one in Limerick connecting \nthe two towns, no doubt, this is the date of its construction. The first \nmention ofj Baals Bridge in our Annals is A.D. 1361, ,vhen J oho of \nGalway (de Burgh) defeated the O'Briens and took the bridge and \npresumably the English town. Irish speaking people call it Droichead \nMao/, i.e., the bald or bare bridge, meaning one ,vithout battlements_ or \nparapets. In Pacala Hibernia (vol. ii, p. 652) Baals Bridge is represented \nwith three detached houses on it, and a cas1cl.Jated gateway at each end; .... \nthat at the Engli'shtown side havi9g a dra,vbridge; 111aking a fifth archway. \nLeniha~, in his History of Limerick, ~assumes that the ro,vs of \nhouses on this bridge were erected before the Williamite sieges; but the \nevidence is all the other way. , The maps of the sieges of 1690 and 1691 \ndo uot show rO\\vS of houses on the bridge. v·1scount Shannon (not the \nEarl of Shannon, as stated by Lenihan) got a grant from the Crown of \nthis bridge, and after the surrender of the city let both sides of it for \nbuilding. It is doubtful if th~re was.-a single brick house built in \nL im·erick before 1691. The Dutch, who settled in the city after that \ndate, established brick ,vorks in the corcass lands on both banks of the \nShannon, and practically rebuilt Limerick. The old stone houses and \n.castles, both in the English and Irish towns, ,vere faced with brick, and \ntwo rows of brick houses were erected on the bridge, leaving just enough \n•",

Tall arid sturdy and \nconfident, looked the young Captain, and in the eyes of Meehal, \nhis adorer, he was the finest and comeliest youth that ever \nstood on a green sward. \nThe burly Conan frowingly advanced and they locked in \na fierce embr ace. \nThe contest was not long in progress till it was plain that \nConan knew much less about the art of wrestling than his \nmodern opponent. Conan's method of attack was nothing \nmore than brute force applied openly and clumsily. Dermot \nRoche seemed to find no difficulty in meeting and cou11ter­\nchecking his attacks. The Fenian hero lifted his opponent \ntime and again off the ground and swung him in the air, but \nthe modern Gael always landed, smiling, on his feet again. \nAt length these stupendous efforts began to tell on Conan \nMaol, and presently he was panting and almost breathless. \nThen the Moondharrig Captain took the aggressive, and \nConan got no chance to recuperate. By a countless number of \ntricks and feints, Dermot Roche kept his opponent in a \nconstant state of alarm, exhausting his remaining strength. \n\"It's comin' now,\" whispered Meehal-na-Gamawn to Oisiu. \n\"Dermot is goin' to do it. I see the look in his eyes he had \nwhen he threw the English champion at Gurtharda, an' broke \nhis collar-bone.\" \n\"Are you goin' to give him the treasgairt, Dermot ? \" he \nasked, speaking in English, which the Fenians didn't und er­\nstand.

The graveyard had formerly belonged to \nan abbey, part of whose walls gray with uncounted years was \nstill standing. Gigantic elm and ash trees surrounded the \nplace, and the breeze stirred their moaning branches into a. \nsolemn dirge for the dead. \nSeveral tombstones, green and tottering with age scattered \naround, and a venerable Celtic Cross, mournful relic of the dim \npast, after the storms of centuries still stood bravely erect. It \nwas indeed a solemn and lonely place, and at night when the \nmournful face of the moon looked at one through the broken \nabbey windows, and the shadow of the Celtic Cross fell darkly \no'er the moss-covered stones, thoughts of death and the here­\nafter, sombre thoughts impossible to express came into the \nmind. \nAs Dermot Roche and his companions bore the coffin in, and \nlaid it by the empty grave, Moran Og's father, a bent and \ngray-haired old man, burst into a passionate lament, unburden­\ning his great sorrow in the expressive Gaelic tongue : \n\"Moran, a mhic mo chroidhe, bh-/uil tu marbh? bh-/uil \ntu marbh.\" (Moran son of my heart, are you dead ? are you \ndead).

Often have you played together on the \nbawn, and your feet was as swift as the wolf-hounds, your eye \nsure, and your arm strong and skilled to strike the ball through \nthe posts, mo chroidhe. They'll miss you, Moran a, mhic, on \nthe hurling field, but your old father will miss you more than \nall! \n\"'Tis you that were the comfort of his life, and earned the \nbread for his eating. The horses heeded your voice in the \nploughing-field and the furrow you made was straight as a \nbeam of the rainy sun. The people passing stopped to admire \nthe straight, smooth-turned sods and to hear your cheery \ngreeting when you turned at the headland. They'll miss you \nfrom field and headland, but mo bh1·on, I'll miss you more \nthan all. \n\"Three nights ago a, mhic-mo chroide coming from Port­\nlaw Fair along the banks of the Suir, near the old castle of \nGurtheen I heard the Banshee cry aloud in the night. . \n\"Och a,nee ! but 'twas a bitter cry, and the flesh ofmy \nheart shook and the sweat came out on my brow with the woe \nand loneliness of it. Moran Dhilish I prayed to God's Son \nthat died for us that you might not be taken, but myself \ninstead, an old broken man. \n\"H 0 willed it otherwise~a.ye-but did He will it?\" Here \na terrible change came upon the affiicted father, a whirlwind \nof passion shook him, his face grew dark and scowling, his \nvoice loud and strident, so that many of the people fell away \nfrom him in terror. \n\"Ay did He will it? No! You were murdered, my \nnoble boy. They murdered you, the hounds of hell, the \nheartless Sassenach ! May the curse of a heart-broken father \nfall on the English dogs that tracked you to death.\" \nGoing on his knees by his son's grave the unhappy man \nnow poured forth the most awful maledictions on England, \nand the British government which he held responsible for his \nson'a death. As he poured forth these terrible imprecations a \nsort of silent a we fell on the crowd. No one stirred until at \nlast Dermot Roche approached and touching the old man on \nthe shoulder said quietly: \nTHE BURIAL OF MORAN OG. 107 \n\"•Tis time for the prayer now, sir, we have the grave \nfilled in.\" \nAt the touch O'Laughlin stood up and looked around him \nwildly, like one awakening from a horrible dream. \n\"The prayer\" he gasped. \"Of course-the prayer.\" Then \nina piteous cry'' Oh Moran, a 1nhic, my innocent boy, have I \nbeen cursing over your grave, you that never hurt man or \nbeast, that never had a bad word in your mouth? Forgive \nme, oh God, and you Moran down in the cold clay, forgive \nme-forgive-\" \nThe old man suddenly put his hand to his forehead, \nstaggered uncertain for a moment-tried again to speak, then \nwith a low, weak cry fell insensible into the strong arms of the \nCaptain of the Hurlers",

He w as coming home one night from the Fair \nof Waterford, and feeling very tired, lay down and fell fast \nasleep on the Fairy R rtth of Glen-na-sulish, of all the places \nin the world! The Good People that live under the Rath, find­\ning him there when they came out to their midnight revels, \nmust have put a heavy spell of their power on him, for when \nhe awoke he found himself in a strange country. \nIt was a very beautiful land his bewildered eyes looked \non. Noble forests and green pastures were there, and on th!;) \nhilltops stood lofty, battlemented castles, worthy to be the \nhomes of kings and chieftains. He looked in vain for a straw­\nroofed cottage or a potato-garden-there was absolutely noth­\ning to remind him of his beloved Moondharrig. \nThe bewilderment of our worthy Gael was indeed great. He \nscratched his head and looked about him with wide open-eyes. \n\" The divil's cure to me, anyway,\" he muttered ruefully \n\"for goin a-near Rory Gallaher's at all; maybe it was a drop \ntoo much I took, an' I remimber goin' asleep on the Rath, \nwhatever misfortune drove me there at all at all.\" \nHow long he might have continued to upbraid himself thus \nwe do not know, but suddenly there was a great crashing· in \nthe underbrush close by, and he had to step aside quickly as \na wild boar, hotly chased, tore past. In another second the \nhunter, running swiftly, came in view, but at sight of Meeha.l \nhe stopped short with every appes.rance of astonishment. \nMeehal-na-Gamawn observed that the stranger was tall and \nbeautifully formed, with hair in long, yellow ringlets falling \nto his waist. His apparel was close-fitting and becoming, and \nseemed to be of some sort of polished leather with clasps of gold. \nIn his right hand was a hunting spear, and in his left a \nsheaf of spears of the same pattern. \nMOONDHARRIG VERSUS TIR-NA-N-OG. 109 \nThere was nought of fierceness in his voice, but a sort of \nsurprise, 1is he inquired : \" How came you, mortal, into the \nLand of the Ever-Young ? \" \n\"That's what I'm thryin' to find out meself,\" answered \nI1foehal, not a whit abashed. \"Rory Galbher had something \nto do with id, an' the Glen-na-sulish fairies had more, but I'm \n:1s innocent of id meself as Pether Keefe's dog that always \nwint around pnrtindin' nothin, I'm Meehal O'Clery of M oond­\nharrig, and maybe if you'd declare yourself we 'd know each \nother better.\" \nThe stranger perceptibly straightened up as he replied \nwith some dignity. \n\"I am called Oisin, son of Finn, the son of Cumhal.\" \nMeohal-na-Gama wn put his hands in his breeches' pockets, \npursed his lips, and admitted a low whistle. \n\"I heard o' you before, Oisin,\" said he.\" I heard tell of you \nbefore Prince, as John L. Sullivan said to the Prince o' Wales.\" \nMeehal regarded the Fenian hero from head to feet with a \nglance that had almost as much admiration in it as that he \nusually bestowed on Dermot Roche, the captnin of the Moond­\nharrig hurlers. Then he proffered a hand-shake to the son of \nFinn. \" Put id there, Oisin\" said he, \" put id there if id \nweighed a ton, man dear; you used to be a little hard on St. \nPatrick (a better man than you or me), but you were a handy \nman in a fight, be all accounts, an' a good Irishman, pagau an' \nall as you were. 'Tis in heaven you'd be now man, an' not \ntearin' thro the woods like this, if you on'y had sinse an' list­\nened to the Saint.\" \n\"Tir-na-n-og is good enough for the son of Finn,\" answered \nOisin with a trace of sadness in his tone. \"Come with me, \nmortal, and see the goodly company of the F ouians.\" \nOisin, leading the way, in a short time came to what seemed \na large palace, and entering they found themselves in an imm­\nense hall. Along this stretched tables groaning beneath the \nmeats and good things set as for a great feast. Hundreds of \nwarriors, many of them clad in gold and brazenarmour,were seat­\ning themselves to eat. \nOisin did not hesitate, but going towards the head of one of \nthe tables found ,eats for himself and his companion , 'l'he",

The names of \nFinn McCumhal, Conall Gulban, Conan Maol, Goll MacMorna' \nand Oscar had been familiar to him from boyhood when \nhe had heard of their great deeds in many a folk-lore tale. \nThat he should see those heroes with his own eyes seemed \nalmost too good to be true. However, there they were, and \njudging by the way they demolished the eata.bles, they were \nvery palp1tble realities. Meehal had no doubt but that the \nmystic-looking chief, with the flowing beard, who sat in the \nchair of honour, was the great Finn, son of Cumhal. \nThe dark, tall youth opposite to him he knew to be Oscar, \nthe son of Oisin, and Conan Maol he knew by his truculent \nbearing and swaggering talk. \n\"How went the chase to-day, Oisin ? \" asked .Finn, \naddressing his son affectionately. \n\"I started the great boar of Glen-davaul,\" answered Oisin, \n\"and followed him from morn till noon. I w as close behind \nwhen I met this mortal in a glade, and so abandoned the chase.\" \nMeehal-na-Gamawn did not look up, but he felt the eagle \neyes of Finn upon him, reading his very soul. \n\"He is from the Land of Eirinn, sir,\" explained Oisin, \n\"and is here against his will.\" \n\"That's gospel truth, anyway,\" put in Meehal. \" I'd give \nanything to be back in Moondharrig, for this must be a foreign \ncountry altogether, from the quare way ye speak the Gaelic.\" \n\"I believe you are a very degenerate race in Erin, now­\nadays,\" said Finn, addressing the bewildered Gael. \" You \nhave been conquered by another people and the love of \nphysical progress has died amongst you.\" \n\"Thrue for you, your lordship,\" answered M.eehal bravely. \n\"The Sassenach beat us because we wouldn't stick together, \nbut in the regard ov a hurlin' match, or a bout o' wrnstlin,' \nwe have as neat a lot o' boys among us as ever.\" \nConan Maol broke in, boe,stful as usual. \" Your boys \nwould be puny wights in the hands of the Fenians at wrestling \nMOONDHARRIG VERSUS TIR-NA-N-OG. 111 \nor at the caman,\" said he. But Meehal-na-Gamawn was \naroused. \n\" Take care now, me big man,'' he cried. \"Take care me \nbucko-if eleven of the Moondharrig hurlers can't make fools \no' you in a gam e, an' if Dermot Roche, their captain, can't \nplough a ten-acre field with your nose at a bout o' wrastlin', \nI'm satisfied to stay in this wicked country an' never to hear a \nchfl,pel-bell again.\" \nConan glared savagely at the undaunted Meehal. \n\"The Fenians,\" he spluttered in a rage, '' the Fenians \nwould sweep your men even as Assaroe sweeps the dead leaves, \nand the goal-ball would be carried in the wind of their rush.\" \n\" Thrue for you, you big liar,\" retorted Meehal disdainfully, \n\"there's more wind than sinse in you, an' no mistake.\" \nGoll reached for a huge spear that hung over his head \nbut at a word from Finn fell back into his seat. \n\"You shall have a chance to make good your vaunting,'' \nsaid the chief, '' we will now adjourn to the plain of prowess, \nwhere Conan will bring his chosen men for the game.\" \nThe whole company now trooped out in the plain in front \nof the pahwe, whe1·e the Feni~ns were accustomed to -hold \ntheir contests. Oisin told his companion that it was modeled \nafter the plain of Tail tea in Meath, where the heroes when they \nwere on earth were wont to disport themselves. \n. C?nan in the mea~time was busy getting his men ready, \nd1vestmg them of their armour and putting on their swift­\nrnnning suits. At last they stood in line, caman in hand \neleven picked men, among whom he recognized Oscar and Goii \nMacMorna. \nWhile he was wondering where their opponents were to \ncome from, Finn suddenly drew apart from the rest, and \ncl~pped his hands together thrice. Like t?e clashing of iron \nsh10lds was the sound he made with his bare hands, and lo! as \nMeehal-na-Gamawn looked, there issued from the skirt of the \ngreenwood opposite. eleven men of the Moo ndharrio· hurlers \ndressed in their suits and with camans • in th.eir hanci\"'s. They \ncame forward in a straight single line, looking neither to the \nright or left, and when close to Finn they saluted him and \nstood immovable.",

It was the pick of all Moondharrig \nwithout any doubt. There was the captain, Dermot Roche, \nthe1·e was :Malachy Gilmartin and Will Hanlon the cul baire, \nand the matchless scriob, Pete O'Hara. The captain, he saw, \nhad recognized him and smiled faintly at him. Indeed there \nwas a look of sleep-walkers about all of them, but they seemed \nevery moment to be coming more like themselves, and the \nclick of the camans as the men lined up was calculated to \nrouse them from their trance. \nFinn walked once up and down the line counting the \nmen. Then coming to the end and shouting '' Ready,\" he \nflung the ball down the line of players.· There was a \ntremendous clash as the camans met, the mass of players \nswayed hither and thither across the field, then the knot broke \nand Oscar got the ball. So swiftly did he run that before the \n:Moondharrig backs got to their places he had passed them \n:.ind scored the first goal while all the exulting Fenians shouted \ntheir joy. But Dermot Roche was now thoroughly aroused, and \ncalling his men together, gave them a talk: \"Look here, \nboys,\" he said earnestly, \"I don't know where we are or what \nall this is about no more than you, but I see our friend Meehal­\nna-Gamawn among those people, an' it runs in my head some \ngreR.t harm will come to him if we don't win this match. Now, \nboys, except this chap that put up the goal, they can't run no \nmore than a parcel of old women, but they strike heavy an' \nhard, so ye must keep them from gettin' fair strokes at the \nball an' annoy them in every way you can. Malachy Gilmartin, \nyou'll attend to the boy that made the goal, see he doesn't get \naway again, if you have to crack him a sly one on the shins. \nAn' now, boys, for the sake of old Moondharrig, we'll take the \nnext two goals an' win the match.\" \nThere was a second line-up and again Finn threw in the \nball. This time it did not go towards the Moondharrig goal, \nbut slowly forged the other way. The fleet-footed Oscar got \nno chance for a run, being rudely jostled and pressed by the \nMOONDHARRlG VERSUS TIR-NA-N-OG. 113 \ntall, young woodranger, Malachy Gilmartin. The other \n~layers of the Fenians, great, heavy men, found their strokes­\nmterfered with in a madd~ning way. Eve1·y time they swung \n01;1 th? ball a Moondharng caman was poked in from some \ndirection or another and made the powerful blow futile. As \nthe game progresse~ the Fenian champions became plainly \nexas~erated and distressed. They were evidently out of \npractice, and unused to the modern tricks and combinations \nof their opponents, and soon showed symptoms of being \nplayed out. \nScarcely giving the ha.flied Fenians a look in. the Moon­\ndha~rig scriobs finally took the ball down into the enemy's \nterritory and passing it from man to man with the accuracy \nof clock-work, eluded the cul baire easily and scored, making \nthe honours even. \nWhen the ball was thrown in for the third and decidino· \ncontest Oscar made a desperate effort to get away with it. H~ \nwould have succeeded had Malachy Gilmartin been off his \nguard, but the young woodranger was on the alert and Oscar \nhad not stolen twenty yards when his ca man was blocked and \nt~e ball taken from him by Malachy, who could run like some \nwild thing of the woods he guarded. \nThe finish of this last game was almost a fiasco. There \nwas a swift r~sh down on the Fenian goal, and the ball zig-zaged \nnever touchmg but Moondharrig camans. Conan Maol was \nstanding with the Fenian goal-keeper trying to regain his \nb~eat~, when the irresistible Moondharrig rush struck him and \nhis big body was flung over and beyond the goal-line as a \nheavy boulder is flung from a powerful catapult!

See therefore that you waste not your \nstrength in idle talk.\" \nBeing apprised of the coming contest, Dermot Roche \nstood quietly waiting for his opponent. Tall arid sturdy and \nconfident, looked the young Captain, and in the eyes of Meehal, \nhis adorer, he was the finest and comeliest youth that ever \nstood on a green sward. \nThe burly Conan frowingly advanced and they locked in \na fierce embr ace. \nThe contest was not long in progress till it was plain that \nConan knew much less about the art of wrestling than his \nmodern opponent. Conan's method of attack was nothing \nmore than brute force applied openly and clumsily. Dermot \nRoche seemed to find no difficulty in meeting and cou11ter­\nchecking his attacks. The Fenian hero lifted his opponent \ntime and again off the ground and swung him in the air, but \nthe modern Gael always landed, smiling, on his feet again. \nAt length these stupendous efforts began to tell on Conan \nMaol, and presently he was panting and almost breathless. \nThen the Moondharrig Captain took the aggressive, and \nConan got no chance to recuperate. By a countless number of \ntricks and feints, Dermot Roche kept his opponent in a \nconstant state of alarm, exhausting his remaining strength. \n\"It's comin' now,\" whispered Meehal-na-Gamawn to Oisiu. \n\"Dermot is goin' to do it. I see the look in his eyes he had \nwhen he threw the English champion at Gurtharda, an' broke \nhis collar-bone.\" \n\"Are you goin' to give him the treasgairt, Dermot ? \" he \nasked, speaking in English, which the Fenians didn't und er­\nstand.

The \nCaptain himself could not do it neater or swifter. Many a time \nthe Gaels sighed as they thought what a tower of strength the \nyoung curate would be to them in the championship matches \nif it were not \"against the rules.\" It is to be presumed, too, \nthat Father John himself often wished he could lend a hand \nwhen the ball came rushing dangerously on the Moondharrig \ngoal. With all his training in self-control he was observed to \nwatch the games with intense interest, and to be elated or de­\npressed according to the varying fortunes of the contest. \nAt the time of which we write a great match for the \ncounty championship was impending between Moondharrig \nand Tullagmore.

Then the \nspell being broken he stepped forward a few paces and looked \ninside the ruin. \nTo his horror there was no human being there, but in a \nshaft of moonlight on the grass-grown floor sat a great wolf­\nhound, that glared at him with hateful eyes of fil'e ! \nWith a shock of anguish and shame the priest realised \nthat he had been delayed on his sacred errand by a ruse of the \nevil one. \nHr,stening forward he endeavoured to make up for lost \ntime, but to no purpose, for when he arrived at the house of \nthe man to whom be had been called he found him already \ndead! The atonement made by the priest of the legend for \nthis momentary carelessness w11s an after0 life of rigorous \npenance and austerity. \nFather Dermody prayed that the hidden God reposing \nnow at his breast mi ght save him always from the sorrow of \nbeing too late to comfort a poor soul in agony and need. His \ncompanions, too, were praying, and the Divine presence brought \ncomfort and assurance to their hearts. \nAnd now as they reached the summit of the \"Gap of the \nWinds,\" where had the storm continued in unabated fury \nthere would have been danger of being blown to destruction \nover the high cliffs that here impended, suddenly came a \nstrange and unaccountable lull. \nThis continued until the party descended from the ex­\nposed ridge into the skelter of the bulging mountain side. \nThe worst of the road was now behind them, . and with grate­\nful hearts they urged their horses to a gallop, nor drew reins \ntill they brought up in front of the cottage of Meehal-na­\nGamawn. The mother of the latter met them at the door, and \nthere was a relieved and thankful look on her face as she sa IV'",

Leaving the others in the little kitchen, the \npriest immediately entered the room of the sick man, and \nclosed the door behind him. \nPlacing the Blessed Sacrament on a small table on which \na blessed candle was burning, he reverently genuflected, and \nwent over to the sick-bed. Meehal-na-Gamawn turned upon \nhim a look of wistful joy that was pathetic to see. \"May \nGod bless you, father, I knew you'd come,\" he said in a weak \nvoice. At a glance the priest could see that the shadow of \ndeath lay there already, and that poor Meehal would never \nagain see the light of day in this vale of tears. \nPutting on his stole, the priest heard the dying man's \nconfession. Then calling in the mother and the two Gaels he \nbade them kneel down while he administered the Holy \nVia tic um. \nIt was a solemn and peaceful scene in that little chamber, \nwhile outside the heavy din of the storm rose and fell. \nTears flowed fast down the manly cheeks of the Gaels as \nthey saw the priest bending to give the last Communion, \nwhile Meehal-na-Gamawn, their beloved friend, welcomed his \nGod with the most tender sentiments of love and hope. How \nsmall and trivial and foolish appeared 2.11 earthly struggles \nand jealousies and triumphs in the presence of this awful \nhour of death! They struck their breasts and prayed for \npardon for their sins, and that a holy and well-prepared-for \ndeath might also be their happy portion at the end of their \nlives. Ah ! well indeed had they loved their dying friend, \n9,nd could it be possible, even now, they would gladly die in \nhis place! \nAnd the noble Irish mother knelt bravely there with a \nhalo of sainthood about her sweet face, and like many another \nstrong-hearted Irish mother offers her son to God without \nreserve. Then the priest performed the rast solemn anointing, \nand gave the blessing in exfrernis to further strengthen that \nsoul that was now girding itself for the final ordeal. \nAn anxious look came into the eyes of Me ehs,l-na-Gamawn. \nTHE FINAL GOAL. 121 \n\"There's one thing, father, that's troublin' me,\" said he, \n\"an' I forgot to tell it to you.\" \nThe two Gaels turned to leave the room, but he beckoned \nthem back. \"It's this, father, I've been sayin' prayers here \nfor th? last fe~ days that t;h? boys here would defeat Tullag­\n:nore m the big match ; an I m sorry now I did, for Tullagmore \nis your home, father, and likely you'd feel badly if they were \nbeaten. I had no right to do it, an' it grieves me now, father, \nthat I did.\" The priest turned away to hide his tears, which \nwhich were now flowing fast. \"It was no harm at all you did, \nMeehal,\" he said, in a broken voice. \" I won't mind it a bit \nif Tullagmore loses, and I know now the boys here will win \non account of your prayers.\"· \nSlowly the night hours dragged past, and the dying man \nlapsed into unconsciousness. From his incoherent sentences \nthey could gather that he was wandering once again with his \nfriends, the Gaels. Once again he watched them run and \nstrike the swift-bounding ball. \nWith strange thrills the Captain and Malachy heard him \ncall out their names-now in tones of entreaty, anon in tones \nof pride and commendation, as though they had just performed \nsome wondrous feat. \nThe priest, closely observant, noted a great change coming \nslowly over the features of the dying man. \n\"We will recite the last litanies now, in the name of \nGod,\" he said. \nPutting the crucifix in the hand of Meehal-na-Gamawn \nthe priest knelt, and began the \" Recommendation of a Soui \nDeparting.\" \nAs he did so, consciousness returned for a few moments \nto the dying Gael, and with great effort he made the first \n1'0Sponses. \"Lord have ~ercy on me,\" he prayed. \"Christ \nhave mercy on me-Holy Mary pray for me,\" then once again \nhe became delirious. \n_Outsi~e through the lone mountain passes, making a \nmusic ternble to hear, the thousand mighty voices of the storm \nrose in hoarse _diapason! \n.

Now, \nthe wind wailed in long-drawn cadences like the desolate \ncrooning of Beansidhe; again a sudden gust seemed to shake \nthe very ground, like the innermost discharge of heavy \nartillery. \nWithin the sick-room the not less terrible and solemn \nlitanies of the Church thundered forth their defiance against \nthe Enemy of Mankind. \n\"Depart, oh Christian soul,\" spoke the priest, \"out of \nthis miserable world, in the Name of God the Father Who \ncreated thee; in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the \nLiving God, Who Redeemed thee; in the Name of the Holy \nGhost, Who sanctified thee.

But as to the just, let them rejoice and be \nhappy in His presence. May all the demons of hell be filled \nwith confusion and shame, and let no evil spirit dare to stop \nthy course to Heaven.\" \nThen the voice of the priest trembled and broke, as he \npra.yed for the soul of his friend :-\n\" Deliver, oh Lord, the soul of Thy servant from all dangers \nof hell, and from n.11 pain and tribulation! \n\"Deliver, ob Lord, tho soul of Thy servant, as Thou didst \ndeliver Lot from f.:blom and the fhmes of fire ! \nTHE FINAL GOAL. 123 \n. \"Deliv~r, ob Lord, the soul of Thy servant, as Thou didst \ndeliver Damel from the lion's den! \n. \"Deliver, oh Lord, the soul of Thy servant, as Thou didst \ndeliver the three children from the fiery furnace.

A great excitement \nshowed on his features, and the hurlers heard their names on \nhis lips again and again. \n. And at first all seemed to be going well with his friends \nm the phantom hurling match, but after some time his face \ngrew downcast, and he muttered repeatedly, \"We are goin' \nto lose-we are goin' to lose !-Moondharrig is lost !-is lost!\" \nThen with startling suddenness he raised himself on one \narm. His voice grew strong, and tense, and eager:-\n\" Ah!\" he cried, \"the Captain has it, at last-he has the \nball! He forces it towards tho goal. God aid you, Captain \nasthore ! Nearer, nearer he comes and they cannot stop him. \nAh! what a stroke !-a goal !-a go9J ! God bless you Captain l \n-it is the final goal I\" \n. Meehal-na-Gamawn fell back on his pillow, and once \nagam, by God's mercy, for a moment of full consciousness, \nhe cast a farewell glance on his heartbroken friends:-\n\" Jesus, Mary, and Joseph assist me,\" he murmured. \nThen like a sudden ripple dying off a still pool the life \nwent out of his face !

See therefore that you waste not your \nstrength in idle talk.\" \nBeing apprised of the coming contest, Dermot Roche \nstood quietly waiting for his opponent. Tall arid sturdy and \nconfident, looked the young Captain, and in the eyes of Meehal, \nhis adorer, he was the finest and comeliest youth that ever \nstood on a green sward. \nThe burly Conan frowingly advanced and they locked in \na fierce embr ace. \nThe contest was not long in progress till it was plain that \nConan knew much less about the art of wrestling than his \nmodern opponent. Conan's method of attack was nothing \nmore than brute force applied openly and clumsily. Dermot \nRoche seemed to find no difficulty in meeting and cou11ter­\nchecking his attacks. The Fenian hero lifted his opponent \ntime and again off the ground and swung him in the air, but \nthe modern Gael always landed, smiling, on his feet again. \nAt length these stupendous efforts began to tell on Conan \nMaol, and presently he was panting and almost breathless. \nThen the Moondharrig Captain took the aggressive, and \nConan got no chance to recuperate. By a countless number of \ntricks and feints, Dermot Roche kept his opponent in a \nconstant state of alarm, exhausting his remaining strength. \n\"It's comin' now,\" whispered Meehal-na-Gamawn to Oisiu. \n\"Dermot is goin' to do it. I see the look in his eyes he had \nwhen he threw the English champion at Gurtharda, an' broke \nhis collar-bone.\" \n\"Are you goin' to give him the treasgairt, Dermot ? \" he \nasked, speaking in English, which the Fenians didn't und er­\nstand.

I don't think that is a great way to write a song, it's better to w rite a song as one unit than just by wo rking wi th \na collection of riffs. \nM ichael M usicwise we are not very like-minded, we don't all like the same music.

The music , generally, which stands the test of tim e is not the stuff which \nfits into various fashions, it's the mu sic that stands out on it's own. \nIt's a lot easier for a band to make it if they latch onto a current sound .

The \nScots and the Tnsh are the wo rst prepared teams this season, through no fault of the play­\ners, that mu ch they have in comm on. Th e Scottish team is in a transitional phase, added \nto that, Gavin Hastings is a do ubtful starter, (at time of goi11 g to press), his steadying influ­\nence on the team will be sorely missed. \nSelected for the Irish team this Saturday are : Peter Clohessy (Young M unsters), \nAnthon y Fo ley (Shannon), K eith Woods , Ben Cronin and Philip Dan a~e r a~l fr~m \nGarryowen . M y unbiased opinion on ne,·t Saturday's gam e is that the L 1m enck mfluence \nwill be enough to carry us to victory over the Scottish. \nFriends at Limerick F.C. wish to thank everyone wh o p artook in our \n'Music' Tab le Qui z at the Desmond Arms last week.

We were lucky the pub we had stumbled \ninto was hosting a Quadraphonic night with Razor one of their resi­\ndents. He served up a jazzy blend of drum n bass and even dropped \nin a few soul tracks and even if the crowd were more into chugging \nback a few cans of cider and listening to Bon Jovi, it w as nice to hear \nthe jazzy blend drifting threw the smoke filled bar. \nWe walked the short distance around the corner to the GPO , for one \nof the highlights of the Weekende r, Mr. Cook a.k.a. Fatboy Slim. The \nvenue was already half full and Johnny Moy , the Influx supremo was \ngrinding together a delicious blend of breakbeats and funky hip-hop, \nthen the unima?inable happened - the music stopped, the houselights \nca~e on and 11 Se~ tplijthat hot food was being served, yum yum . \nThis was thanks to t~ e ·Galway Gardai, who believed that food served \nin the nightclubs would deter people from going to fast food restau­\nrant after the clubs and starting fights, this must be with out doubt the \nmost ridiculous idea ever thought up in the history of mankind. I \nalways believed that some chicken curry served during a club, while \nthe music was stopped would bring a halt to trouble on the streets of \nIreland. \nThen exactly at 12.15 am Fatboy Slim took to the decks and began the \nparty, and he was in the mood for a party. Starting off with some jump \non the table hip-hop, he started to get his audience in the mood .After \nabout twenty minutes he drops in Cornershop, his own mix of \n'Brimful Of Asha' and this drifts straight into Renegade Master \n'Wildchild', the crowd react as if they have been told that work has \nbeen called off on Monday and that they will still get paid. Things begin \nto heat up and the bassline is starting to rip the plaster of the walls, \nthe sound of summer is upon us, the crowd are ecstatic more plea­\nsures are in the post. Dr. Bone 'Came to get ripped' starts the crowd \ninto samba dancing and at this stage the venue is at boiling point and \nis danger of being leveled to the ground, but there is no holding back \nand nobody is complaining. Next its a slice of demon jungle and cheer \ngoes up and up and up, hey !!! where has the roof gone no matter \nkeep dancing. He then drops Freddy Fresh 'Drum Lesson', a swinging \nsurf tune with a devilish beat and then the volcano erupts and still the \nparty continues, they seem to be dancing everywhere on chairs, tables, \ncounters and on shoulders. Even by the table the mod boys are beat­\ning the counter to the sound of the drum, their life has been spiced \nup. The music then at two o'clock grinds to a halt and heads turn and \nstare at amazement it can't be over. So Norman gives us one more \none that really maybe has no place but is a fitting end The Verve's \n'Bitter sweet symphony'. The houselights are turned on and the \nbouncer's begin their familiar bark. We grab our coats and fall outside \nwhere the wind and rain are driving everyone home. All that can be \nsaid is please, please it all was a better living for CHEMISTRY. \ndrop20 \nfatboyslim \nThe World Cup is only four months away and everyone is scrambling \nfor the position and honour to record their countries football \nanthem, Pulp, Boo Radleys and Damon Albarn are all in the running, \nbut it looks as if Echo And The Bunnymen have emerged as the book­\nies favorites. Meanwhile Teenage Fanclub are in contention to provide \nScotland's song for the World Cup campaign, with the dire Wet Wet \nWet and Del Amitri among other candidates. \nThe Verve are to release 'Sonnet' as a single, but on 12-inch vinyl only, \nit will be sold in a customized Verve cardboard envelope.They will also \nrelease the last three singles on vinyl for the first time. The return of \nthe 7-inch. \nGarbage are just putting the final touches to their second album, \n'Versions 2.0'. The first single is to be 'Push lt'-and no its not a \nSalt'n'Pepa cover. The album will contain a cover of Big Star's \n\"Thirteen\". There's also a song with the working title of \"Special\", \nwhich has been described as a tribute to Chrissie Hynde lead singer \nwith the Pretenders. \nWilliam Reid, of the Jesus And Mary Chain, is releasing his first ever \nsolo single, titled 'Tired Of pl=l=l<ing'.The Mary Chain, who have just re­\nsigned to Creation, will be back later this year with a new album. \nMicheal Hutchence committed suicide, according to the coroner and \nhe didn't die from an act of auto-eroticism, well isn't that a story. \nA friend of mine has brought to my attention that Cornershop's \n'Brimful Of Asha' is a rip off of Lou Reeds 'Sweet Jane', well its not a \nnew idea stealing a riff from someone else's song for your 45. \nA new charity album, intitled 'Gimmie Shelter' is released on March 9. \nThe CD boasts of an excellent line-up, Everything But The Girl, \nProdigy, Snuff, Reef, Cast, Audioweb, 808 State, Bis, 3 Colours Red , \nJamiroquai, Dubstar and the delightful Mark Owen . Irish band Ash, \nappear on the album with a live version of 'Let It Flow' recorded at \nthe Astoria in London. Talking of Irish bands, Limericks own pop dar­\nlings, The Hitchers have been nominated in the Hotpress awards, \nwhich will be held in Belfast in a few weeks. \nOcean Colour Scene release 'It's A Beautiful Thing', which still gives no \nevidence to suggest that they don't deserve to go down in history as \none of the most boring bands to have sold an obscene amount of \nrecords. Drum n bass maestro LTJ Bukem releases more easy listen­\ning tunes 'Mystical Realms' and finally French duo Daft Punk kick back \nwith 'Revolution 909' another roaring, blinding dance floor filler. \nA new regular feature starting this week titled CLASSIC \nBUYS will advise the reader to part with their money and buy \nthe CD's we talk about. This week its Nightmares On Wax",

ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NOT BEEN \nIN THE LIMELIGHT TOO MUCH IN IRELAND IN RECENT MONTHS, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY. DROP SPOKE TO \nPEARSE DOHERTY OF THE SAWDOCTORS AND FOUND OUT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN UP TO AND WHAT THEY HAVE IN \nSTORE. \nDescribed in the tour programme for \nlast year's North American tour as; a \nFinal year college drop-out, a former \nMcDonald employee and Beck enthu­\nsiast, bass player Pearse Doherty \ncomes across as an easy going laid \nback kind of a guy. He is totally befit­\nting the many descriptions of the \nband's laid back \"of the people\" atti­\ntude. It was said of them that \"you'll \nlisten in vain for the usual rock cliches \nabout a life on the road, drug prob­\nlems and easy sex\" this is not their \nstyle - instead they sing about the \nordinary things in life but not in a \ncountry and western kind of a way. \nSo what have the Saw Doctors \nbeen up to since .... well since whenev­\ner we last heard of them whenever \nthat was. The last single released in \nIreland was at the end of 1996 - yes \nnearly a year and half ago. Pearse \nexplains \"well after that we took some \ntime off - six months off just to go \naway from it all and come back fresh. \nJan, a friend asked us to Sunstreet stu­\ndios to write songs with Padraig \nStevens who started writing with \nDavy (Carton) and Leo (Moran). They \nrecorded as they went along and dur­\ning February and April last year 20 \nsongs were recorded\". \ndrop18 \nWith material for a new album under \ntheir belt the Sawdoccors then decid­\ned co make a concerted effort at the \nimmense American audience, doing 28 \ndaces in a very shore time frame. The \nefforts were rewarded when a small \nNew York based record company, \nParadigm records signed them. Until \nthen the Sawdoccors records were \nonly available through import in \nAmerica which meant that they cost \ntwice the normal price. They used \ntheir own record label \"Shamtown \nRecords\" until then but as P~arse put \nit \"We couldn't bring our label to the \nstates and we needed a record com­\npany on the ground\" Paradigm are \njust chat although they wouldn't be \nthe biggest record company in the \nworld or even the state and this is \ntheir first ever signing of a band from \noutside the states. \nA U.S. album was quickly cut which \ncomprised of a \"best of .. \" the initial \nthree albums from the Sawdoctors. It \nwas released last November and sold \nover 20,000 copies which isn't bad \ngoing. According to Pearse \"our pro­\nfile is increasing in the states in our \nlast tour alone we played to over \n1 \nl",

This was \ndue in no small way to the North managing to burgle a one-nil win \nbut also due to their frankly baffling appointment of the ancient and \nbewildering Lawrie Mc Menemy as their new manager which was \nannounced the day before the game . The ugly scenes outside Tolka \nPark distracted from the game too when it became apparent that the \nFAI had seriously underestimated the interest in this game on both \nsides of the border. The result being that well over a thousand people \nwho had bought tickets in advance were locked out while their seats \nwere occupied by people who had received complimentaries from the \nFAI (at this point is anyone elses mind awash with phrases like \"pis­\nsup\", \"brewery\" and \"couldn't organise a ... \"?). The game itself held a \ncouple of nuggets of information and revelations though, the first \nbeing, ... and I'm sorry ye've to hear this from me, ... IRELAND WON'T \nBE WINNING the World Cup , European championship or anything \nelse any.time soon. \nBeyond that we've learned that Damien Duff is indeed a fine foot­\nballer and that while St. Johnstone & Northern Ireland's George O' \nboyle knows where the back of the net is - no such thing can be said \nwith any certainty of Barnet and Republic of Ireland striker Sean \nDevine, so as the coach carrying the glorious sons of Ulster roared \naway to the North, with the breeze enveloping their glad hearted ren­\ndition of \"Who put the ball in the back of the Fenian bastards \nnet .... George did, George did\", we were left wondering who will pro-\nvide an alternative to the ageing Niall Quinn, the pacey but lightweight \nDavid Conolly or the seemingly always injured Keith O' Neil// At least \non this showing it won 't be Sean Devine anyway. \nReturning to the northern Ireland/Lawrie McMenemy thing a \nminute ...... what are the IFA thinking? They fired the tactically limited \nBryan Hamilton despite his excellent coaching, developmental and \norganising skills (amongst other things, the north have now have an \nU-18 side for the first time instigated by Hamilton) and replaced him \nwith McMenemy - ten years Hamilton's senior, every bit as tactically \nchallenged, hasn't a clue about coaching, cares less and introduces \nhimself as a prospective northern \"big jack\". I hope it stays fine for \nhim.",

No \nwonder then that his 1997 team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella fell out so \nsoon after their one and only season together.The lowest point of this \nhigh jinxed relationship came when Ralf somehow got it into his ever \nsomeone who at times suffers from the God Complex. \nAnd this leaves Eddie Jordan (team principal} with a bit of a problem. \nWe all realise that both his 1998 drivers (Young Ralf and auld Damon \nHill) are capable of making up a dashingly dynamic duo - feared by \nsome. faster than most and admired by all -with Damon supplying the \nexperience and Schumacher providing the raw speed needed to \nachieve this, but if both end up hating one another, then all we'll be left \nwith is a disgruntled, unmotivated ex-World Champion, a Deutch­\nlandic hotshoe as directionless as ever and still no victories. Looking \nenlarging skull that Giancarlo didn't merit being ahead of him in the at the evidence from last year the odds aren't exactly stacked in \n:~::n:::e:::~d:;r;~eand so naturally enough put teutonic foot to Eddie's fav:~:.-.. ~;,:o_~,,:~~ht be a swe~, \\it\\fl~er guy .... !!!! \n---===-== ,··· .. .\"·ff~(! \n- ·' On a more positive note, if all the unfortunate Fisichella off \nthe road, into the gravel \ntrap and out of the race. \nHe later defended this \nmost unsporting of \nactions by declaring, \"I \nwas travelling faster than \nFisichella at the time, so \nit was inevitable I should \nattempt to pass him'. \nWell now , the worlds media \n(and everyone else) had but two problems with this explanation. \nFirstly, as of the last time we checked, attempting to pass is not the \nsame as slamming into the side of another car, and second, the only \nreason Ralf was travelling faster at the time was because, unlike the \nprudent Italian, he had failed to reign in his speed as they approached \none of those tight corner thingies (somewhere where full throttle \nalways equals straight on, not go round, tyre barrier, smashed, bent, \nbroken, car, etc, etc ...... ). \nNot very clever and not very nice. Not very clever for the simple rea­\nson that had this little coming together not occurred it looked likely \nthat both Jordan's were going to occupy the top two slots by the time \nthe chequered flag was unfurled, and not very nice because it really \npissed off Fisichella - being the leading Jordan driver at the time he \nwould have inherited the aforementioned win (Ralf went on to take \nthird). Conclusion? Ralf Schumacher exhibits all the characteristics of \n' pieces do slot together, and the \ndrivers remain good working part­\nners, then we're sure to see all the \npotential of Jordan's 1997 season \nflower into something less frus­\ntrating than a medley of missed \nopportunities, crashed cars, blown \ntyres, mind boggling mistakes and \ncareer crushing mechanical failures \n- how about several legitimate poles \nand wins maybe . So now, as we all prepare to knuckle down for anoth­\ner 17 rounds of the championship lets sit back, break out a couple of \nbeers and take solace from the fact that both Damon and Ralf have \npublicly stated their desire to co-operate, get along and hopefully to \nrid the team of their perennial wannabe status. \nIts funny though, when Ralf said recently that Damon would give a \ngreat deal of technical input to the team and that he (Schumacher) \nwas sure to benefit from this - as they \"worked well together\" - I \ncouldn't help thinking back to Argentina and Ralf's habit of saying \nthings that when examined closely were in exact opposition to reali­\nty. Lets just hope then that, as with all bad habits, he has learned to rid \nhimself of this particularly unwholesome trait, and that he will become \nrenowned for getting across the line first and not simply for being \nfuzzy with his logic when getting people cross!",

We were lucky the pub we had stumbled \ninto was hosting a Quadraphonic night with Razor one of their resi­\ndents. He served up a jazzy blend of drum n bass and even dropped \nin a few soul tracks and even if the crowd were more into chugging \nback a few cans of cider and listening to Bon Jovi, it w as nice to hear \nthe jazzy blend drifting threw the smoke filled bar. \nWe walked the short distance around the corner to the GPO , for one \nof the highlights of the Weekende r, Mr. Cook a.k.a. Fatboy Slim. The \nvenue was already half full and Johnny Moy , the Influx supremo was \ngrinding together a delicious blend of breakbeats and funky hip-hop, \nthen the unima?inable happened - the music stopped, the houselights \nca~e on and 11 Se~ tplijthat hot food was being served, yum yum . \nThis was thanks to t~ e ·Galway Gardai, who believed that food served \nin the nightclubs would deter people from going to fast food restau­\nrant after the clubs and starting fights, this must be with out doubt the \nmost ridiculous idea ever thought up in the history of mankind. I \nalways believed that some chicken curry served during a club, while \nthe music was stopped would bring a halt to trouble on the streets of \nIreland. \nThen exactly at 12.15 am Fatboy Slim took to the decks and began the \nparty, and he was in the mood for a party. Starting off with some jump \non the table hip-hop, he started to get his audience in the mood .After \nabout twenty minutes he drops in Cornershop, his own mix of \n'Brimful Of Asha' and this drifts straight into Renegade Master \n'Wildchild', the crowd react as if they have been told that work has \nbeen called off on Monday and that they will still get paid. Things begin \nto heat up and the bassline is starting to rip the plaster of the walls, \nthe sound of summer is upon us, the crowd are ecstatic more plea­\nsures are in the post. Dr. Bone 'Came to get ripped' starts the crowd \ninto samba dancing and at this stage the venue is at boiling point and \nis danger of being leveled to the ground, but there is no holding back \nand nobody is complaining. Next its a slice of demon jungle and cheer \ngoes up and up and up, hey !!! where has the roof gone no matter \nkeep dancing. He then drops Freddy Fresh 'Drum Lesson', a swinging \nsurf tune with a devilish beat and then the volcano erupts and still the \nparty continues, they seem to be dancing everywhere on chairs, tables, \ncounters and on shoulders. Even by the table the mod boys are beat­\ning the counter to the sound of the drum, their life has been spiced \nup. The music then at two o'clock grinds to a halt and heads turn and \nstare at amazement it can't be over. So Norman gives us one more \none that really maybe has no place but is a fitting end The Verve's \n'Bitter sweet symphony'. The houselights are turned on and the \nbouncer's begin their familiar bark. We grab our coats and fall outside \nwhere the wind and rain are driving everyone home. All that can be \nsaid is please, please it all was a better living for CHEMISTRY. \ndrop20 \nfatboyslim \nThe World Cup is only four months away and everyone is scrambling \nfor the position and honour to record their countries football \nanthem, Pulp, Boo Radleys and Damon Albarn are all in the running, \nbut it looks as if Echo And The Bunnymen have emerged as the book­\nies favorites. Meanwhile Teenage Fanclub are in contention to provide \nScotland's song for the World Cup campaign, with the dire Wet Wet \nWet and Del Amitri among other candidates. \nThe Verve are to release 'Sonnet' as a single, but on 12-inch vinyl only, \nit will be sold in a customized Verve cardboard envelope.They will also \nrelease the last three singles on vinyl for the first time. The return of \nthe 7-inch. \nGarbage are just putting the final touches to their second album, \n'Versions 2.0'. The first single is to be 'Push lt'-and no its not a \nSalt'n'Pepa cover. The album will contain a cover of Big Star's \n\"Thirteen\". There's also a song with the working title of \"Special\", \nwhich has been described as a tribute to Chrissie Hynde lead singer \nwith the Pretenders. \nWilliam Reid, of the Jesus And Mary Chain, is releasing his first ever \nsolo single, titled 'Tired Of pl=l=l<ing'.The Mary Chain, who have just re­\nsigned to Creation, will be back later this year with a new album. \nMicheal Hutchence committed suicide, according to the coroner and \nhe didn't die from an act of auto-eroticism, well isn't that a story. \nA friend of mine has brought to my attention that Cornershop's \n'Brimful Of Asha' is a rip off of Lou Reeds 'Sweet Jane', well its not a \nnew idea stealing a riff from someone else's song for your 45. \nA new charity album, intitled 'Gimmie Shelter' is released on March 9. \nThe CD boasts of an excellent line-up, Everything But The Girl, \nProdigy, Snuff, Reef, Cast, Audioweb, 808 State, Bis, 3 Colours Red , \nJamiroquai, Dubstar and the delightful Mark Owen . Irish band Ash, \nappear on the album with a live version of 'Let It Flow' recorded at \nthe Astoria in London. Talking of Irish bands, Limericks own pop dar­\nlings, The Hitchers have been nominated in the Hotpress awards, \nwhich will be held in Belfast in a few weeks. \nOcean Colour Scene release 'It's A Beautiful Thing', which still gives no \nevidence to suggest that they don't deserve to go down in history as \none of the most boring bands to have sold an obscene amount of \nrecords. Drum n bass maestro LTJ Bukem releases more easy listen­\ning tunes 'Mystical Realms' and finally French duo Daft Punk kick back \nwith 'Revolution 909' another roaring, blinding dance floor filler. \nA new regular feature starting this week titled CLASSIC \nBUYS will advise the reader to part with their money and buy \nthe CD's we talk about.

It's got \na pronounced natural acoustic feel and does \nindeed have jazz elements. It has technical intri­\ncate yet lightweight composition. I shyly enquired \nwhether they would identify the Cardigans w ith \nthemselves, fully expecting a torrent of artistic \nindignation. Imelda, however wasn't offended; \"I \nguess we would be easy listening\". \nShane agreed that the group has a retro feel to it \nbut put it in context -\"We go back to Bette \nMidler and further back to thirties Jazz\" He \nstrummed a chord and elaborated \"That's E -\nWhether you're playing Country and Western , \nJazz or heavy metal; its always E. Mozart used E. \nYou can't create much new movements. So every­\nthing is retro.\" \n\"In the sixties a trend lasted 5 years. New age \nmusic changes with the technology. It's \nchanged from acid to house to handbag to \ntechno to rave. Things are going in and out \nof fashion a lot quicker. I'd like Mammadoo \nto ignore that\" \nThe group are considering expanding their \nline up, but enlisting a clarinet, saxophone \nor keyboard player brings with it an extra \nmember to payroll and another person to \nbe educated to the sound of Mammadoo . \nThe bands influences are not immediately \napparent in their music. Shane cited Bob \nMarley and the Pixies as artists he admired \nbecause \"they turned mus ic on its head\" \nWhen the band ·started in late 1995, he \nwent through a period of not listening to \nthe radio as \" a groove had to be found \nbefore we could continue\" He explained \nand played a few bars. \n\"On it's own that's just a jingly - jangly gui­\ntar\" \nHe nodded towards Ronan and played the \nsame intro this time with bass and vocals \" \nI couldn't survive without the band and \nthey couldn't survive without me\" \nThe interview officially ended here, but as I \ncollected my equipment and began to deci­\npher my substandard shorthand, Shane said \n\"C'mon we'll play you some tunes\" and \nthey did. \nwith 'Smokers Delights' released in the summer of 95. A wicked working of okey dokey beats. \nThis album was true to its title an album for the herbalist, it contains the classic tunes 'Mission \nVenice' an up-beat journey threw the valleys of Narnia, 'Stars' which takes on the hip-hop feel \nand drifts in and out between the floating clouds which cover the concrete urban jungle and the \nopening delight of'Night lntrolude' with a sample of'Summer In The City' by Quincy Jones, a gem \nto grace the beginning of any journey in to the delights which smokers delight holds for you.

We were lucky the pub we had stumbled \ninto was hosting a Quadraphonic night with Razor one of their resi­\ndents. He served up a jazzy blend of drum n bass and even dropped \nin a few soul tracks and even if the crowd were more into chugging \nback a few cans of cider and listening to Bon Jovi, it w as nice to hear \nthe jazzy blend drifting threw the smoke filled bar. \nWe walked the short distance around the corner to the GPO , for one \nof the highlights of the Weekende r, Mr. Cook a.k.a. Fatboy Slim. The \nvenue was already half full and Johnny Moy , the Influx supremo was \ngrinding together a delicious blend of breakbeats and funky hip-hop, \nthen the unima?inable happened - the music stopped, the houselights \nca~e on and 11 Se~ tplijthat hot food was being served, yum yum . \nThis was thanks to t~ e ·Galway Gardai, who believed that food served \nin the nightclubs would deter people from going to fast food restau­\nrant after the clubs and starting fights, this must be with out doubt the \nmost ridiculous idea ever thought up in the history of mankind. I \nalways believed that some chicken curry served during a club, while \nthe music was stopped would bring a halt to trouble on the streets of \nIreland. \nThen exactly at 12.15 am Fatboy Slim took to the decks and began the \nparty, and he was in the mood for a party. Starting off with some jump \non the table hip-hop, he started to get his audience in the mood .After \nabout twenty minutes he drops in Cornershop, his own mix of \n'Brimful Of Asha' and this drifts straight into Renegade Master \n'Wildchild', the crowd react as if they have been told that work has \nbeen called off on Monday and that they will still get paid. Things begin \nto heat up and the bassline is starting to rip the plaster of the walls, \nthe sound of summer is upon us, the crowd are ecstatic more plea­\nsures are in the post. Dr. Bone 'Came to get ripped' starts the crowd \ninto samba dancing and at this stage the venue is at boiling point and \nis danger of being leveled to the ground, but there is no holding back \nand nobody is complaining. Next its a slice of demon jungle and cheer \ngoes up and up and up, hey !!! where has the roof gone no matter \nkeep dancing. He then drops Freddy Fresh 'Drum Lesson', a swinging \nsurf tune with a devilish beat and then the volcano erupts and still the \nparty continues, they seem to be dancing everywhere on chairs, tables, \ncounters and on shoulders. Even by the table the mod boys are beat­\ning the counter to the sound of the drum, their life has been spiced \nup. The music then at two o'clock grinds to a halt and heads turn and \nstare at amazement it can't be over. So Norman gives us one more \none that really maybe has no place but is a fitting end The Verve's \n'Bitter sweet symphony'.

That Friday was a balmy day and Sir Peter Strickland might have \nbeen lulled into the thinking that it was to be symbolic of better days \nahead, if so he was to be sadly disillusioned.

Indeed it appears that demobilised soldiers far outnumbered \nIRA members in Newcastlewest. Matters came to a head on Thursday \n15 January when the vigilance committee was attacked while it was \npatrolling the streets by numbers of ex-soldiers. Eventually the IRA \ntook a hand directly and reinforcements were drafted into the town from \nthe outlying companies and this group tackled the ex-soldiers. In the \nscuffles that followed it does appear that at least one revolver shot was \ndischarged and an ex-soldier named Timothy O'Sullivan was wounded \nin the arm. The IRA contended that O'Sullivan had pulled a knife and \nthat Garrett McAuliffe had drawn a revolver and wounded him. The \nintervention by the IRA had the impact of forcing the ex-servicemen \nto seek the sanctuary of the RIC barracks. It appears that the IRA may \neven have laid siege to the barracks as it was stated in a future court case \nthat a number of the windows of the barracks were broken after the ex­\nservicemen had sought sanctuary. This is substantiated by a claim for 19 \npounds compensation which was lodged with Newcastlewest Board of \nGuardians for damage to windows of the barracks which it was alleged \noccurred on the night of 15 January.343 \nThe RIC, who had not bothered to curb the activities of the \nmarauding ex-soldiers, carried out a series of raids on the homes of \nIRA and Vigilance Committee members on the morning of Tuesday \n27 January. They arrested nine men and charged them with 'disturbing \nthe public peace in a manner calculated to cause a riot.' The nine men \n341 \n342 \n343 \nLimerick Leader 30 April 1920.

After they \nhad been charged the nine men were removed to Limerick Prison where \nthey were held pending trial. The trial, if such it could be called, was held \nat Adare on 10 February. The nine defendants 'refused to recognise the \ncourt' and as they also refused to remove their hats these were forcibly \nremoved by the escorting military. The case for the prosecution was based \non staterrtents made in Newcastlewest RIC Barracks by ex-soldiers, \nThomas Cronin and Thomas Hanly. However as both men rescinded \ntheir testimony in court the case for the prosecution collapsed.344 Among \nother ex-soldiers who had been summoned to attend were John Jordan, \nJohn Dillane, Thomas Reilly, John Cronin and Edward Murphy. Each \nof these men was supposed to give evidence but they failed to show up \nfor the trial. The case against the defendants was handled by District \nInspector O'Callaghan who pursued the matter very strenuously. \nO'Callaghan was ultimately unsuccessful and when the case eventually \ncollapsed the charges had to be withdrawn. Substantiating evidence was \ngiven by Constable Peyton but the fact that the two main witnesses \nfailed to support their statements meant that the case was doomed. In \naddition the fact that five other witnesses failed to turn up meant that \nthe Resident Magistrates, Mr Jones and Colonel Williamson, had no \nchoice but to throw out the case and release the men. The case for the \ndefence was handled by Mr James H Moran. \nIn January 1920 the posturing and small scale activity that had characterised \nthe latter months of 1919 came to an end when the first serious attempt \nwas made to capture a well protected RIC Barracks.

The joint patrol, under \nCaptain Lloyd, had reached the corner of O'Connell Street and Roches \nStreet when they were jeered and taunted by the youths who ran up \nRoches Street and then down Augustinian Lane. Lloyd gave an order to \nopen fire and some of the soldiers fired wildly down Augustinian Lane \nand also up Roches Street. It was from one of these volleys that Richard \nO'Dwyer, a 38-year-old publican, who lived at 11 Roches Street, on \nthe corner of Roches Street and Catherine Street was shot dead as he \nworked behind the counter of his pub. The patrol then moved back on \nto O'Connell Street where further shot were fired which resulted in a \nnumber of shop windows being broken. At the junction of O'Connell \nStreet further volleys were fired in the direction of Sarsfield Bridge. It was \nas a result of these volleys that a 23-year-old usherette, Lena Johnson, was \nshot. Miss Johnson was on her way home to Thomondgate when she was \nstruck by a bullet in the abdomen as she walked over the swing section \nof Sarsfield Bridge. She was taken into the Shannon Rowing Club by \na number of passersby and from there she was moved to Barrington's \nHospital where she succumbed to her wounds later that night. A third \ncivilian named Laurence Murphy had a narrow escape when he was struck \nin the leg by a bullet wQile he was crossing Patrick Street. Fortunately for \nMurphy his wounds, whilst serious, were not fatal and he soon recovered \nafter being moved to Barrington's Hospital. When word of the shootings \nspread through the city a party of three soldiers was attacked by a crowd \nof civilians. The soldiers were coming down Glentworth Street from the \nrailway station when they were set upon. The soldiers were soundly beaten \nbut fortunately for them they managed to escape to the refuge of the main \nmilitary barracks. As a consequence of the shootings both military and \nRIC were confined to their barracks for the night ofTuesday 3 February, \nand as a result, that night passed off peacefully.357 \nThe funerals of Richard O'Dwyer and Helena Johnson were huge \nmanifestations of the abhorrence by the citizens of the city at the actions \n357 \nLimerick Leader Friday 6 February 1920 \nThe Deepening Crisis 269 \nof the police and military. Richard O'Dwyer, who was a native of Coun·ty \nTipperary, was buried at Kilpatrick, near Dundrum, on Wednesday 4 \nFebruary 4 following Requiem Mass in St Michael's Church in Limerick. \nHelena Johnson was buried in Mount St Lawrence Graveyard, also on \nWednesday, following Requiem Mass in St Munchin's Church. Huge \ncrowds followed both funerals as they wound their way through the city. \nIt was claimed by the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and the RIC that they \nhad been fired on beforehand and that they had returned fire. Sergeant • Jeremiah Moroney of the RIC stated that when the patrol had passed \nthe junction of Roches Street and O'Connell S'treet a shot was fired at \nthem. They were then 'hissed at' by six or seven youths and a further six \nor seven shots were fired at the patrol from the direction of Augustinian \nLane. When the patrol moved up to engage this position a further volley \nof shots was fired from near Thompsons shop at the corner of Roches \nStreet and Catherine Street. It was at this stage that Sergeant Conroy \nof the RIC was wounded. 358 Batty Stack in his statement says that the \nIRA did open fire and that both he and Timothy Murphy fired shots \nfrom Thompson's corner. The intention was to shoot Sergeant Conroy \nwho was regarded as being particularly obnoxious by the IRA. 359 In his \nstatement Stack says that they managed to wound Conroy but this does \nnot appear to have been the case as there was no account of Conroy \nhaving been wounded. Captain Lloyd ordered his men to open fire and \nat least two soldiers, Private Poulton and Private Higgs, appear to have \ntaken this as a licence to fire indiscriminately and at random. O'Dwyer \nwho was an innocent man was shot in his premises on the opposite \nside of the street to Thompson's corner where Sergeant Moroney says \nthe shots came from. A number of eyewitnesses including a Sergeant­\nMajor O'Donnell, who was home on leave, were adamant that the first \nshots were fired by the patrol in reply to the jeering. Even if the IRA \nhad opened fire first in Roches Street and was indirectly the cause \nof the death of Richard O'Dwyer, it does not account for the patrol \nfiring down Sarsfield Street where Helena Johnson was killed and the \n358 Limerick Leader Wednesday 11 February 1920 \n359 WS 525 Witness Statement of Michael] (Batty) Stack (Bureau of Military History) p.5",

The newspapers of the time seemed to reflect this with numerous \ninstances of clashes being recorded between soldiers and civilians long \nbefore Sinn Fein and the IRA had captured the loyalty and support \nof the broad mass of the urban working class. A certain uneasy peace \nseemed to settle on the city and county for the rest of the month of \nFebruary and the early days of March. \nIn March\" 1920 an ambitious plan was drawn up by the IRA in east \nLimerick, for an attack on a strongly held barracks in the county. The \nbarracks targeted was the one situated in the village of Doon. The attack \nwas planned for 7 March 1920 and as with many operations in the East \nLimerick and South Tipperary Brigade areas this operation was planned \nas a joint operation with men from both areas participating. There was \nalso a detachment of men from the North Tipperary Brigade. Among \nthe areas that lent men for the attack were Doon, Cappawhite, Hollyford, \nRearcross, Donohill and Rossmore. The RIC garrison at Doon consisted \nof one sergeant and six men. The sergeant in charge was Sergeant Michael \nMadden, a man of almost 60 years of age.361 As the men tasked to carry \nout the attack took their places, a heavy fall of snow lay on the ground. The \nplan of attack entailed placing an explosive charge against one gable end \nof the barracks and securing it in place with railway sleepers.362 Because \nof the weather the fuses that were lit to fire the mine went out. Also the \ndefenders seemed to be alert to the fact that the barracks was about to be \nattacked and when the gelignite mine was eventually exploded it failed to \nbreach the wall of the barracks. In retaliation the defenders threw out a \nnumber of grenades. The attackers consisting of a party of about 50 men \nopened fire on the barracks from the front and rear with rifles and shotguns, \nbut as they were unable to breach the gable wall the attack was doomed to \nfailure and it was called off after some time to conserve ammunition. The \n361 The garrison at Doon had changed completely by 1 January 1921 when Sergeant \nMadden had retired and only Constable Peter Merrigan of the original garrison was \nstill based there. Following the re-organisation of the RIC in April 1920 the garrison at \nDoon was increased to 2 sergeants and 12 constables. \n362 WS 1453 Witness Statement ofWilliam McCarthy (Bureau of Military History) p.7",

Why Forde \nwas fired on is not clear but it may have been that he was mistaken \nfor his brother who was serving as an RIC sergeant in William Street \nBarracks. Fc,rde it appears had taken part in some of Captain Robert \nScott's Antarctic expeditions. \nOn the same night in Rathkeale policemen, guarding a boycotted land \nagent, were attacked in the hotel where they were staying. Apparently \nSergeant George Neazor and a Constable Garret Doyle, both of whom \nwere stationed in Tralee, were sent to escort a man named O'Brien to \npurchase cattle at the fair in Rathkeale.367 O'Brien was purchasing cattle \nfor a boycotted farm and this was the reason for the police escort. For \nsecurity purposes it seems that Neazor and Doyle, whilst armed with \nrevolvers, were dressed in civilian clothing. However George Neazor \nwas of Palatine stock from near Pallaskenry and he was recognised at \nthe fair by a farmer named John Nolan.368 Nolan was not a member \nof the IRA but it does seem that he was an active supporter. Nolan \ncontacted James Roche of the Rathkeale Company. Indeed not alone \ndid Nolan inform Roche ofNeazor's presence but he also identified him \nto Roche. Roche passed on the information to Sean Finn who was at \nthat stage the OC of the West Limerick Brigade IRA. Finn arranged \nfor a number of men to tail the two policemen. It was established that \nboth men, along with O'Brien the cattle buyer, were staying overnight \nin Ward's Hotel. It was also discovered that Neazor had arranged a \n367 C onstable Do yle had to retire on pension from the RIC because of his w ounds. He was \nlater awarded £1,148 in compens ation at Limerick Summer A ssizes. -L imerick L eader \n9 July 1920. \n368 John Nola.n later served as a Cuma nn-na-nGael TD for Limerick from 1923-27, \n1927-1932.

To this end a raid was carried out on a mail train \nat Killonan Junction on Friday 2 April and a large sum of money was \ntaken. However before the guns could be purchased a directive was issued \nby IRA headquarters that the money was to be returned to the railway \nauthorities and the opportunity to purchase the guns was lost. As a result \nof the diredive there was a stormy meeting between Peadar Dunne, the \nthen OC of the Mid Limerick Brigade, and its most active member. \nWhen the disagreement between Stack and Dunne could not be resolved \nStack decided to move to Dublin where he became an active member of \nMichael Collin's squad. He spent the rest of the period up to the Truce, \nunder the command of Paddy Daly. The departure of Batty Stack took \nmuch of the sting out of the IRA in Limerick city. \nOn Thursday 18 March, a patrol of three RIC men, travelling from the \nPetty Sessions at Pallaskenry to their barracks at Kildimo were ambushed \nat Kilcrohane. Constable Patrick Moran, a 25-year-old from Aughamore \nin County Mayo was seriously wounded in the neck and shoulder and \nSergeant John Portobello was slightly wounded in the wrist.370 The RIC \npatrol was forced to surrender their revolvers and ammunition. Both \nConstable Moran and Sergeant Portobello were moved to the hospital \nattached to the main military barracks where a press release stated that \nConstable Moran's condition was stated to be 'not very satisfactory'. 371 The \nambush was carried out by a party of seven IRA men armed with shotguns \nand revolvers. 372 A number of the ambushing party were members of the \nPallaskenry IRA Company.

Because of the manner by which previous insurrectionary \noutbreaks had been compromised by the work of spies and informers, \nthe IRA were very conscious of the need for accurate information \ngathering on one hand and the identification and elimination ofenemy \nintelligence agents on the other hand. The traditional efficiency ofDublin \nCastle in gathering information on the minutest detail of Irish life and \nnationalism, largely by means of the RIC, was also a matter that weighed \nheavily with Republican leaders.

      "raw_text": "268 The War of Independence in Limerick \nOn the evening of Monday 2 February, a mixed patrol of RIC and \nWelsh Fusiliers were jeered and booed by a crowd of youths who also \nattacked the patrol with a fusillade of stones. The joint patrol, under \nCaptain Lloyd, had reached the corner of O'Connell Street and Roches \nStreet when they were jeered and taunted by the youths who ran up \nRoches Street and then down Augustinian Lane. Lloyd gave an order to \nopen fire and some of the soldiers fired wildly down Augustinian Lane \nand also up Roches Street. It was from one of these volleys that Richard \nO'Dwyer, a 38-year-old publican, who lived at 11 Roches Street, on \nthe corner of Roches Street and Catherine Street was shot dead as he \nworked behind the counter of his pub. The patrol then moved back on \nto O'Connell Street where further shot were fired which resulted in a \nnumber of shop windows being broken. At the junction of O'Connell \nStreet further volleys were fired in the direction of Sarsfield Bridge. It was \nas a result of these volleys that a 23-year-old usherette, Lena Johnson, was \nshot. Miss Johnson was on her way home to Thomondgate when she was \nstruck by a bullet in the abdomen as she walked over the swing section \nof Sarsfield Bridge. She was taken into the Shannon Rowing Club by \na number of passersby and from there she was moved to Barrington's \nHospital where she succumbed to her wounds later that night. A third \ncivilian named Laurence Murphy had a narrow escape when he was struck \nin the leg by a bullet wQile he was crossing Patrick Street. Fortunately for \nMurphy his wounds, whilst serious, were not fatal and he soon recovered \nafter being moved to Barrington's Hospital. When word of the shootings \nspread through the city a party of three soldiers was attacked by a crowd \nof civilians. The soldiers were coming down Glentworth Street from the \nrailway station when they were set upon. The soldiers were soundly beaten \nbut fortunately for them they managed to escape to the refuge of the main \nmilitary barracks. As a consequence of the shootings both military and \nRIC were confined to their barracks for the night ofTuesday 3 February, \nand as a result, that night passed off peacefully.357 \nThe funerals of Richard O'Dwyer and Helena Johnson were huge \nmanifestations of the abhorrence by the citizens of the city at the actions \n357 \nLimerick Leader Friday 6 February 1920 \nThe Deepening Crisis 269 \nof the police and military. Richard O'Dwyer, who was a native of Coun·ty \nTipperary, was buried at Kilpatrick, near Dundrum, on Wednesday 4 \nFebruary 4 following Requiem Mass in St Michael's Church in Limerick. \nHelena Johnson was buried in Mount St Lawrence Graveyard, also on \nWednesday, following Requiem Mass in St Munchin's Church. Huge \ncrowds followed both funerals as they wound their way through the city. \nIt was claimed by the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and the RIC that they \nhad been fired on beforehand and that they had returned fire. Sergeant • Jeremiah Moroney of the RIC stated that when the patrol had passed \nthe junction of Roches Street and O'Connell S'treet a shot was fired at \nthem. They were then 'hissed at' by six or seven youths and a further six \nor seven shots were fired at the patrol from the direction of Augustinian \nLane. When the patrol moved up to engage this position a further volley \nof shots was fired from near Thompsons shop at the corner of Roches \nStreet and Catherine Street. It was at this stage that Sergeant Conroy \nof the RIC was wounded. 358 Batty Stack in his statement says that the \nIRA did open fire and that both he and Timothy Murphy fired shots \nfrom Thompson's corner. The intention was to shoot Sergeant Conroy \nwho was regarded as being particularly obnoxious by the IRA. 359 In his \nstatement Stack says that they managed to wound Conroy but this does \nnot appear to have been the case as there was no account of Conroy \nhaving been wounded. Captain Lloyd ordered his men to open fire and \nat least two soldiers, Private Poulton and Private Higgs, appear to have \ntaken this as a licence to fire indiscriminately and at random. O'Dwyer \nwho was an innocent man was shot in his premises on the opposite \nside of the street to Thompson's corner where Sergeant Moroney says \nthe shots came from. A number of eyewitnesses including a Sergeant­\nMajor O'Donnell, who was home on leave, were adamant that the first \nshots were fired by the patrol in reply to the jeering. Even if the IRA \nhad opened fire first in Roches Street and was indirectly the cause \nof the death of Richard O'Dwyer, it does not account for the patrol \nfiring down Sarsfield Street where Helena Johnson was killed and the \n358 Limerick Leader Wednesday 11 February 1920 \n359 WS 525 Witness Statement of Michael] (Batty) Stack (Bureau of Military History) p.5",
