A fluent Gaelic speaker, he was a prominent figure at\nevery Aeridheacht; his local brass band, of which he felt so proud, was\nalways accorded an honoured place at all the great demonstrations of\nthe early Land League, but as a temperance reformer his good work was\nincalculable. The local Temperance Hall was his creation, and many\nhumorous tales are recorded of his efforts to capture the erring one.\nOn one occasion he happened on a party of three who, having forgotten\nthe pledge, retired to a private house and were revelling in a high time\nwhen the door opened and his reverence appeared. There was no\nescaping the pledge, and the defensive arguments drifted towards com-\npromise. No, he would not allow them two drinks, nor even one for\nthe morrow. The party had been imbibing “mulled stout” through the\nmedium of an old’ teapot commandeered for the occasion, and as a last\nresource one of them, pointing to the apparently harmless old pot near\nthe fire, asked indifferently; “‘ Would you let us drink what’s in the tea-\npot itself?” “Oh,” replied his reverence, mistaking its contents, “you\nmay drink all you like out of the teapot,” and after the pledge they did,\nand were found two days later worse than ever, by his reverence, carry-\ning out the letter of the pledge through the teapot. Father Casey\nbecame suspicious of “teapot” pledges after that. Having run down a\npledge breaker at another time, the latter astonished Father Casey by\nasking: “ Were you ever drunk, Father?” “No,” smilingly replied his\ncaptor, “why do you ask?” “Because,” he continued, “I know you\nweren't, for if you ever lived until the next morning you'd never think\nit necessary to preach another sermon on the ‘Cure of Drink.’”",

There is every indication that there\nwill be full lists in every grade of both games, except Senior Burne\nwithin the next five years. The winners in Britain also take par\nin the Junior championships each year. aa\naddition to these open championships, All-Ireland Colleges\nFevctiions have been in operation since 1928. They embrace all\nfour provinces in Football, and Leinster and Munster in Hurling.\nConnacht entered for the latter in 1934 and will certainly do SO\nagain.

Of course the use of arms, as then understood, and the\npopularity and necessity of certain military services, accounted for\nall those events peculiarly associated with contemporary soldiership,and\nhow formidable that soldiership was, let its antagonists tell. But on\nthe non-combative side there was a splendidly varied programme of\nbeneficial exercises, of which most survived until recent days, and the\nefiect of which are distinctly traceable in the physique of our country-\nmen in districts where intercourse with outside races has had a\nminimum of influence.\nTt is above all a proof of the physical qualities of our race, and of\nfhe fruitful traditions which guided it, that it was rather proficiency in\n\"all branches, than excellence in any one, that secured princely reward.\nm earlier days the warrior and champion proved his valour and\nertness in all branches, conditions, and feats ; and in this connection\nly Gregory’s recital of Setanta’s taking arms is illuminating and\ninteresting reading for those to whom Irish records are not accessible\npracticable. The civilian athlete had the weights, and leaps, and\ncunning in which to display his mettle, and the hurling and wrestling\n‘and water feats as well. Those who had strength without speed, or\n“expertness of eye or hand without general suppleness of limb, secured\nlittle attention. The all-round ideal prevailed, and as the candidate\nyr the Fianna had, (as we read in Keating), to run with loosened hair\nhro’ a wood, stoop under a branch lower than his Imee, and leap higher\nthan his head, tread so lightly as not to break a decayed twig, and pull\na thorn from his foot without stooping, we may logically conclude\n“no difficulty was found in securing recruits of such expertness amongst\nGaels of that day. .\nfo. one carefully studying early life in Ireland can ignore the\neminence which was given to the National pastime of Hurling in all\ntblies. We have a few historic instances of the iniquitous\nof badly borne defeats (a trait even noticeable to-day), and can\nfrom the importance attached to the result, the high esteem\nich the game was held.

          "raw_text": "Thursday August 17th -Wednesday August 30th• LI I ERIC IC EV EN TS Ii U IDE \nASH \n'Girl From Mars' \nFor this their new single ASH have taken a sharp turn \nfrom the coy reminiscing that made the recently \nreleased UNCLE PAT such a hit.The martial arts refer­\nences of KUNG FU have been abandoned in favour of \nplanetary references which convey the far out nature \nof Tim Wheelers lost love.The song opens w ith yo ung \nTim 's strained voice lamenting the girl wh o never \nknew of his love for her,before crashing into the usual \nmael strom of distorted guitar ,heaving bass and disap­\npointing ly lightweight drums .Produced by form er \nCure bass player Phil Th omally,it successfully vari­\nates on a so far winning formul a and even includes a \npiano overdub.Let's hop e Tim gets his by now infa­\nm o us A Levels and doesn't have to spend another \nyea r giving the teachers notes asking them to leave \nhim off his home w ork because he's go ing on tour w ith \nElastica.A sure fire hit. \nTHE HERM \n'DEMO TAPE' \nWith the current crop of yo un ger band s such as \nSUPERGRASS et al wanting nothing m ore than to \nfeel \"Alright\", I must admit a certain am ount of baf­\nflement at the emergence of band s such as THE \nHERM . From the five song s on the tape one cannot \nbut get the impression that they take them selves very \nseriously. Hailing from in and around the city ,the \nH erm have been on the go for a year or so now gigging \naround various hostelries. \nI mu st concede that I was very excited listening to the \nopen ing bars of the first song. Okay so the four chords \nit's based around have been done to death but for m e \nit was the voca ls w hich enthralled, managing to get \nuncannily close to \"slow ly goes the night\" era of Nick \nCave .Unfortunately , the said vocalist soon decided \nthat rather than sounding like Australia's greatest \nCabaret singer, he'd like to emulate the 'least articu­\nlate man to scream in.to a Shure SM5 8' -yes I am talking \nabout Eddie Vedder . Despite relatively goo d sound \nquality(especially in the context of dem o tapes) ,on \nsome tracks it was impossible to work out the lyrics. \nThat said,when they were coherent,they seemed \nsomewhat disjointed and perhaps relying too much \non the usual rock cliches : \"Darkest dreams , deepest \nfears\"etc. The instrumentation is top notch with good \nbalance between th~ musicians and this alone.should \nhold them in good stead. Herm show considerable \npromise but they really ought to lighten up. Ifs only \nrotk n'roll after all. • \nTHURSDAY 17TH \nTHEATRE \nThe Belltable Pentecost 8pm \nTheatre Royal T erm ights \nPUBS \nBaker Place The Strawber­\nries \nEries Bar Funky Bands & \nFunky DJs \nDolans Trad Session \nFoley's Acoustic session \nThe Sallyport Trad Session . \nCLUBS \nBaker Place lndle Dan ce \nPery's STONE FREE alter­\nnative mu sic \nSimply Delicious Th e Savoy \nDan ce \nThe Works C harts/Dance \nThe Lodge Nile Club, Kilmur ­\nrey House Hotel, \nC harts/Dance -Ladies free \nFRIDAY 18TH \nTHEATRE \nThe Belllable Perntecost \n8pm \nThe Theatre Royal Termights \nPUBS \nBaker Place Just 4 Grooves \nDolans Trod Session \nFoley's Bar,-Shonn on St., \nLost O rders \nThe Round House M uls \nMen \n·The Sallyport Au stin Du rock \n6 -8.30pm w ith Bar.B.Q . \nThe Tait Bar Tony Kiely/ \nPool Tournamen t \nCLUBS \nDoc 's Nile Club \nCharts/Dance \nFunk That Boker Place -\n(Jou/Funk/Soul) \nStrictly Rhythem Savoy (Top \nFloor) -Garage/Dance -\nGuest Warren K \nThe Works The Savoy -\nCharts/Dance \nTermights Theatre Royal -\nlndie Disco . \nThe Lodge Nile Club Kilmur­\nrey House H otel -\nCharts/Dance \nThe Pery New Town Pery -\nCharts/Dance . \nSATURDAY 19TH \nTHEATRE \nThe Belllable Pentecost \n8pm \nTheatre Royal Dance \nNation \nPUBS \nBaker Place Eosi Singles \nDolans Trod session \nEric's Bar Funky Bond s & \nFunky DJs \nRound House I, Me , Mine \nThe Newtown Pery flesh \nTuxido \nTh e Tail B?r Blue Velvet \nCLUBS \nBaker Place Charts/Dance \nDance Nation -The Theatre \nRoyal -Dance \nDoc's -The G ronery -Charts \nSATURDAY 19TH \n/ Dance \nPery's Newtown Pery \nCharts/Dance \nStrlcHy Rhythem Savoy (Top \nFloor) -Garage/Dance \nThe Lodge NIie Club -The \nKllmurrey House Hotel -\nC harts/Dance \nThe Works Savoy -\nCharts/Dance . \nSUNDAY 20TH \nPUBS \nBaker Place John Steel \nBand \nDolan's Trad Session \nFoley's 2 to the Bar \nMickey Martins Acoustic \nSession \nNancy Blakes Trod Session. \nThe Locke Bar Trad Session. \nThe Newtown Pery Th e Flxx \nThe Tait Bar Blades \nCLUBS \nArmitage Shanks Baker \nPlace -lndie Rock \nDoc 's -Th e Granary -\nC harts/Dance \nThe Lodge Nile Club -The \nKilmurrey Lodge Hotel -\nCha rts/Dance -Ladies l /2 \nprice before 12.30 \nThe Pery New Town Pery -\nCha rts/Dance \nStrictly Rhythem -Top Floor \nSavoy -Dance \nThe Works Savoy -\nMONDAY 21ST \nPUBS \nBaker Place Live Music \nDoc 's Acous tic Jorn Session \nDolans Trod Session \nNancy Blakes Trad session. \nCLUBS \nPery's The New Town Pery -\nCharts/Dance \nThe Works Savoy -\nCh arts/Dance \nTUESDAY 22ND \nPUBS \nBaker Place Jo Browne \nDolans Trod Session \nCharlie Chaplin's Willie \nBrowne Live \nThe Locke Bar Trod Session \nNancy Blakes Trad Session \nThe Sallyport Trad Session \nCLUBS \nFreeblrds Boker Place -\nlndie/rock \nPery's Newtown Pery Porty \n-Jimmy Keogh Charts.& \nOldies \nThe Works Savoy - 80's \nMusic \nLEG \n061-419477 \n088-609113 \nCAESARS CAFE \nLimerick's First \nAll Night Cafe \nThurs~ Fri, Sat nights \n7fl4HotMOft,iH,/o-'t,fJet'l, \n~~a/te't,~/ud­\nM 'Z)14eo-/ \n3 Dock Rd, Limerick \nPage Thirteen \nLISTINGS \nClub Attitude ..

Being ace L .E .G jour­\nnalists we naturally headed b ack stage. The \ncrowd there consisted of 99% of people like \nus, looking around for s omeb ody famous .

And this \nwas just the queue for th e train ti \nup ,Wake up. , .... No , it's not the \nBOO RADLEYS song but the shouting o f the s ta­\ntion ma ster, telling us to get o ff the noon \ntrain . Dragging our F amily sized tent with us, \nwe em erged into the bright sunlight ( that \nwas to continue for the wh ole o f the next \nthree days) and proceeded directly to .... the \nnear est pub.A few hours later , we em erged \nfrom there, back into t he the cool even ing \na ir , and proceeded to the campsite by bus. \n__ We~l , what we thought was the c amp site. It \nwas in fac t at the end of a track about a \nmile long sober and abou t e ight miles long \ndrunk.We set up the tent beside a large \nmarque e (which we naturally assumed was \nkind o f alcohol selling establishment) and \nheaded on for Paire Ui Ca oimh wh ich - a ll the \nway back up the forest track and abou t tw ice \ntha t d istance aga in.

Being ace L .E .G jour­\nnalists we naturally headed b ack stage. The \ncrowd there consisted of 99% of people like \nus, looking around for s omeb ody famous . Unf or-\ntunately the mi nute we s a t down we were \ninterview ed by Pat o 'Mah ony who seeme d t o be \ncaught under the mis taken imp ression that we \nwere the James Ta y lor Quartet. Odd tha t, see­\ning as how there was six of us there. First \ntruly famous person of the day spotted was \nNICK CAVE clad in luminous yellow shorts, \na Hawaiian shirt with a stuffed Koala bear \nround r.is neck and a surf board under his \narm ....... Well no. Actually he was all in \nblack - including his girlfriend - and he \ntried to bum a quid o ff us to buy a drink. \nHe obviously needed a stiff JD as he was \nabout to join KYLIE on stage for a d uet. A \nthousand prepubescent fantasies flooded \ninto the collective male psyche of the \nstadium as she took to the stage and the \nmoshing at the front during \"Better the \nDevil you Know \" was merely an effort to \nget close to· the navel- revealing, for.mer \ntea-time temptress.
