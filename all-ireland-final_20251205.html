This ca_n only lead to increased gates as \nLimerick won't be forced to play in the early afternoon. Gone will be difficult \nchoices between watching Lim erick V's Longford Tow n in the pissing rain or \nsettling down by a warm fire with a mu g o' cha to watch Leeds United whip \nMan Utd ., on Sky. \nTalking of Man Utd ., (known affectionately as \"Th e Scum\" to those of us who \ndon't support them), I was glad to see them finally playing a decent gam e of \nEuropean footie the other night as they went out of the European C up with a \n_thoroughly entertaining ff ultimately useless 4 -0 wi n over Ga latasaray. \nThe rnain football action this week will of course be the England 'B' V's Rep . \nof Ireland game at Anfield on Tuesday night. H ard one to predict as both Big \nJack and El Tel are fielding bloody strong team s. You shou ld recognise m ost of \nthe names on the Ireland side - lads like Alan Kernaghan and Eddie \nMcGoldrick who played a big part in our World Cup Qualification and A lan \nMcloughlin , who scored the goal that took us to the finals. As Ireland don 't \nhave a competitive game 'til late March, it's also a goo d chance to get much of \nthe squad together for a work o ut. \nAnd what of our m ost recent competition gam e - the 4 - 0 trouncing of \nNorthern Ireland in Belfast ? I really don't think it's sunk in wi th peop le and \nit probably won't until later.in the qualifying series.

The No rth were , \nof course, (and there's really no kinder way of putting it) .... utter shite. The \nqualifying series isn't even half way there yet and they've already m ade a time \nhonoured balls of it. Northern Ireland have now lost the two games they could \nleast afford to lose - Portugal and the Republic in Belfast. In all likelihood \ny'see, they'll lose to us again in Dublin and to Portugal in Lisbon. They really \nneeded to take something from the Belfast games and failed mi serably in that \n• regard. Are there any words of consolation I can offer them ?? ........ Tough shit, \nlads!

Liam is nothing like the dogmatic dynamo you'd expect.to \nbe fronting Britain's most popula; rave band . In fact, he is everything you never expected (­\nbut, now realise, exactly what you were hoping-) he would be! He talks fervently about \nmusic, affectionately about fellow band members an~ sorrowfully about Britain's newly \nimplemented 'Big Brother' law tactics. He is -inother words - a true representative of what \nRave is all about. \nClassically trained in piano and claiming a past passion for hip hop, Liam started his musi­\ncal career as DJ with London rap act, Cut to Kill. However, travelling regularly from his \nhomet ow n of Braintree in Essex to London 's rap gigs, he found himself quickly disillu­\nsioned with hip hop's scene, and turned, eventually, to the embrace of dance culture. \n\"London was the m~in place for hip hop - heavy black scene - it was when Public Enemy \nwere really big and they wouldn;t stop going on about 'black power' and stuff like that. So \nevery time we went to a hip hop concert we were _faced with these problems of feeling real­\nly on edge all the tim·e. We felt intimidated. As for Cut to Kill - I felt that the music was real-· \nly _good but that the rappers weren't that good and I wanted ·to meet people who were ... \nwell, who were really good and then we could get on together. In the end, 1 just got so fed \nup with the whole scene - I still loved the music b,ut I just decided to move on to something \nelse and that's vyhen l started going to techno clubs.\" \nIt was here in local techno club, The Barn, that he met up with The Prodigy dancers, 25 year \nold Leeroy Thornhill and Keith Flint. Leeroy,.who had heard one of Liam's homespun tapes \napproached him and suggested they start gigging together. Not known for being slow off \nthe mark , Liam immediately agreed, and, taking on the added talents of Maxim Reality \nM.C., the rest -as they say - is history. \n\"Our first gig,\" he remembers fondly, \"was in a really dodgy und~rground club in Hackney. \nKeith got his car broken into and all sorts of stuff happened . The owner told us that he held \nparties there on a Friday and a Saturday night. The Friday was the quiet night. Saturday \nwas the main one.

Few Jive acts in \nthis era of disposable music would'Tisk it. But then again, few live acts \nare truly like THE PRODIGY. From giddy rave anthem 'Charly' to \nastral-roots styled 'Out of Space' to_ the guitar-fused-drum techno of \n'Voodoo People', The Prodigy have dived deep into unchartered \nwaters of dance sound but h_ave continuously come back with pearls. \nIt is such musical mutations (which would possibly be seen by a more \nmainstream act as a threat to band longevity) that provides The \nProdigy with their edge, and maestro behind the band, 23 year old. \nLiam Howlett, with grounds to be proud. \n\"O ne thing I've always said is that The Prodigy are open-minded . We don't tie ourselves to \none style of music. I hate hearing people say that we 're techno or we're breakbeat or we're \nthis or that. That limits us. If we say we're a techno band then that cuts out playing any slow \ntempo stuff, it cuts out the mellower sounds, and basically gives us a tight outline of what \nwe're allowed to do . So, we usually say that we 're just a hard dance act.\" \nHis voice is hush, quiet. He is eager to help, to provide the facts, but he starts sentences and \nthen lets them trail off to a sigh. Liam is nothing like the dogmatic dynamo you'd expect.to \nbe fronting Britain's most popula; rave band . In fact, he is everything you never expected (­\nbut, now realise, exactly what you were hoping-) he would be!

In all likelihood \ny'see, they'll lose to us again in Dublin and to Portugal in Lisbon. They really \nneeded to take something from the Belfast games and failed mi serably in that \n• regard. Are there any words of consolation I can offer them ?? ........ Tough shit, \nlads! Har Har Dee Har Har Har !1 \nFinally, back on the home front again, Limerick were unlucky to lose 1 -0 away \nt~) UCO on Sunday last. Okay so they lost - but Limerick F.C. kept the score a \nlot more respectable than most others m;maged against the in-form students. \nLimerick F.C. are a team worthy of your support.

From the five song s on the tape one cannot \nbut get the impression that they take them selves very \nseriously. Hailing from in and around the city ,the \nH erm have been on the go for a year or so now gigging \naround various hostelries. \nI mu st concede that I was very excited listening to the \nopen ing bars of the first song. Okay so the four chords \nit's based around have been done to death but for m e \nit was the voca ls w hich enthralled, managing to get \nuncannily close to \"slow ly goes the night\" era of Nick \nCave .Unfortunately , the said vocalist soon decided \nthat rather than sounding like Australia's greatest \nCabaret singer, he'd like to emulate the 'least articu­\nlate man to scream in.to a Shure SM5 8' -yes I am talking \nabout Eddie Vedder . Despite relatively goo d sound \nquality(especially in the context of dem o tapes) ,on \nsome tracks it was impossible to work out the lyrics. \nThat said,when they were coherent,they seemed \nsomewhat disjointed and perhaps relying too much \non the usual rock cliches : \"Darkest dreams , deepest \nfears\"etc. The instrumentation is top notch with good \nbalance between th~ musicians and this alone.should \nhold them in good stead. Herm show considerable \npromise but they really ought to lighten up.

And this \nwas just the queue for th e train ti \nup ,Wake up. , .... No , it's not the \nBOO RADLEYS song but the shouting o f the s ta­\ntion ma ster, telling us to get o ff the noon \ntrain . Dragging our F amily sized tent with us, \nwe em erged into the bright sunlight ( that \nwas to continue for the wh ole o f the next \nthree days) and proceeded directly to .... the \nnear est pub.A few hours later , we em erged \nfrom there, back into t he the cool even ing \na ir , and proceeded to the campsite by bus. \n__ We~l , what we thought was the c amp site. It \nwas in fac t at the end of a track about a \nmile long sober and abou t e ight miles long \ndrunk.We set up the tent beside a large \nmarque e (which we naturally assumed was \nkind o f alcohol selling establishment) and \nheaded on for Paire Ui Ca oimh wh ich - a ll the \nway back up the forest track and abou t tw ice \ntha t d istance aga in. Considering there w as \nabou t 20,000 there it didn't take us long to \nfind p eop le w e knew and i t took them an even \nshorter time to tell us we 'd missed ASH,PWEI \nand GRASSHOPPER - the very bands we 'd come \ndown on Friday to see . Being ace L .E .G jour­\nnalists we naturally headed b ack stage. The \ncrowd there consisted of 99% of people like \nus, looking around for s omeb ody famous . Unf or-\ntunately the mi nute we s a t down we were \ninterview ed by Pat o 'Mah ony who seeme d t o be \ncaught under the mis taken imp ression that we \nwere the James Ta y lor Quartet. Odd tha t, see­\ning as how there was six of us there. First \ntruly famous person of the day spotted was \nNICK CAVE clad in luminous yellow shorts, \na Hawaiian shirt with a stuffed Koala bear \nround r.is neck and a surf board under his \narm ....... Well no. Actually he was all in \nblack - including his girlfriend - and he \ntried to bum a quid o ff us to buy a drink. \nHe obviously needed a stiff JD as he was \nabout to join KYLIE on stage for a d uet. A \nthousand prepubescent fantasies flooded \ninto the collective male psyche of the \nstadium as she took to the stage and the \nmoshing at the front during \"Better the \nDevil you Know \" was merely an effort to \nget close to· the navel- revealing, for.mer \ntea-time temptress. Before Kylie,TRICKY \nand co . had rocked the stadium with an \nexcellent set which suffered majorily due \nto it's early time slot. Likewise BLACK \nGRAPE, who provoked the first pogoing of \nthe day w:i:th \"Reverend Black Grape\" .The \nhighlight of the weekend was up next in \nthe shape of 5\"5 ' New Yorker M:>BY who blew all \naway wi th h is brace of Hi-NRG stompers inter­\nspersed wi th a cover of Purple Ha ze and a \nHusk er Du style guitar numb er of his own .After \nthat the PRODIGY served as something of a let­\ndown and with the double interruption o f two \npowercuts. during the set - the second one sig­\nnalling set 's end - it was a bad end to a mid-\ndling day . And just when we thought it \ncouldn't get any worse : When we reached our \ntent we discovered that that large blue mar­\nquee was not a large blue drinking establish-\nment of sorts bu t weekend home of the Hare \nKr ishna 's . So it was we found ourselves sub­\njected t o chan ting until 8 :45 the next morn-\ning. Ha!Ha! But us ten t dwellers go t our \nrevenge on the Hare Krishna's by climbing up \none side o f their tent and sliding down the \nother.And I thought Hare Krishna's were non \nv io lent .........••• \nSaturday night merged into Sunday morning and \neventually a p oint where sleep no longer ma t­\ntered was reached . We made it to the s tadium \nH mmm .... Kylle's \nnavel. \nLoui se 's nipples, \nDamon ·s sweat \nstain s. \nPaul 's pout ...... \nWHERE ARE T HE \nPICT URES O F \nT E RE N CE 'S \nCHEST??! \nLIFE \nthey played all their hits - and even in \nsp ite of their delectable new singer -they \nwer e o nly the wa rm up bout to the main fight \nthat wa s BLUR .They had an aw ful lo t to live \nup t o did BLUR and while there w as nothing \nparticularly ,wr ong with the performan ce, \nit's just that it seemed a bit .... \nwell ... dead, Parklife w ithout Phil Dani els \nwa s a let down and the new material just \ndidn't seem to go down all that well. Fun and \nall, bu t it could have been a w hole lot \nbetter . \nDespite fevered attempts,we managed to miss \nSCHTUM and instead had to sit through the \nDEVLINS and REVELIID before stay ing ou t for \nthe Monkeetastic bu t none the less appropri­\nately mo nikered DODGY .

          "raw_text": "The 26th November, 1910, will be a red-letter day in the annals\nof our games, as it furnished a revelation of the great awaken-\ning in the Colleges. Magnificent in all respects was the meeting\nof College representatives who assembled on that day in the\nShelbourne Hotel in Dublin. The chair was occupied by the\nVery Rev. John Doody, President of St. Kieran’s College, Kil-\nkenny, who had specially travelled up from Kilkenny for the\noccasion. Enthusiastically did he extol the merits of our\nmanly pastimes, and with like enthusiasm did Father Kelly, of\nSt. Mary’s College, Knockbeg, second Father Doody’s proposi-\ntion for the inauguration of the Championships. Representa-\ntives were also present from St. Enda’s College, St. Patrick’s\nTraining College, Marlboro’ Training College, the College of\nScience, the Albert Agricultural College, the National Univer-\nsity College, and Trinity College. Communications expressing\nwillingness to join the competitions came from St. Peter’s Col-\nlege, Wexford; Dominican College, Newbridge; Good Counsel\nCollege, New Ross, and Mount St. Joseph’s College, Roscrea.\nSurely a meeting such as this makes full amends for past\nneglect! The most satisfactory feature of all was the fact\nthat the movement came from within the Colleges themselves,\nfor the circular convening the meeting was issued from Professor\nDoody, Ph.D., of St. Enda’s College. The officers of the\nGoverning Committee were elected as follows : —Chairman, the\nVery Rev. J. Doody; Vice-Chairman, Mr. P. H. Pearse, B.A.\nB.L., the Founder and Principal of Sgoi Ganna; and Hon.\nSecretary and Treasurer, Daithi de Burca, 4 Gardiner’s Place.\nDublin. The following are the principal conditions of the\nChampionships, but it is likely that a slight change may be\nmade in the age limit for the junior contests.",
