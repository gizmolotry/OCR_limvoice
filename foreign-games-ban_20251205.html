They complain\nthat the game is oftentimes greatly marred by the undue\nfrequency of fouls, and that these fouls appear to be\ndue chiefly to the fact that the G.A.A. Rules permit\nthe player to field the ball, i.e., take the leather into\nhis hands either “‘in the air’’ or ‘‘on the hop,’’ while\nthe very same rules forbid an opponent to catch the\nman in possession of the ball, charge him from behind,\nand so forth. They say that it is not m human nature\nto expect that a player should abstain from catching an\nopponent who holds the ball and looks on, as it were,\nat the latter getting the leather away at his ease. F'ur-\nther, our friendly critics would go so far as to suggest\nthat no player should be allowed to use his hands at\nall, either in taking the ball ‘‘in the air’’ or ‘‘on the\nhop,’” and that the ball should be played entirely on\nthe ground. In other words, they would have the\nG.A.A. authorities so to alter the present rules govern-\ning the playing of Gaelic Football that our matches\nwould become so many exhibitions of what may be\nbriefly called ‘‘Ground Football.’”",

If our readers\nwill refer to what we have said about the play of the\nfulls, they will easily be able to construct the needful\nalteration of tactics. It is clear that the two fulls will\nhave to’play somewhat closer to each other, and that\nthe same understanding which we have suggested should\nexist between the centre-full and the goal-keeper in the\nfifteen aside game needs to persist between the two\nplayers mentioned and the goal-man in the present\ncircumstances. Hence, if the right-full goes out to\nsave, the left-full drops in between him and goal, and\nvice versd on the left side. Otherwise the play is very\nmuch the same.

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

As I pointed out in last issue, the attempt to grow toba.cco and cm e it last year has been a fair success, and I am pleased to record it; though, as Colonel E -verard states, the American expert, through some bungling of the Department, did not arrive on the scene until the crop was gathered in and partially cured.

But why is the permission to grow the plants restricted to two places, now that it has been proved the industry is a successful and a profitable one? Why more especially when there is such a splen­ did concession given in the reduction of one-third of the duty by the Tax authorities? Last year several applications were made to the Department to be allowed to grow the plats, and the Department instead of honestly and straightforwardly refusing the permission, for which possibly they had valid and sufficient reasons, shuffled and dallied with their replies, throwing the on",

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

And the LEAD ER has \ncertainly stiffened the backs of the mere IrishPapi_sts and \nmade them realise that they have at least a nght to \nexist. You see evidences of this in the unlikeliest places. \nSome time since a Conservative candidate was con­\ntesting Stephen's Green. Po!itics asi~e,. he was a de­\ncent fellow enough, and he said that his ideal of a. har­\nmonious Ireland was such a mingling of creeds and con­\nvictions, all with a common purpose of goodwill, as was \nfound in the coffee room of the Four Courts. Another \nsanctuary of legal reputation is the. dining ,hall· at \nKing 's Inns. At six: o'clock each evemng, what Byron \ncalls·\" the tocsin of the soul, the dinner bell\" sounds, \nand the bench, the bar and the budding barristers sit \ndown to dine. \nScarcely a man of any note in the history of Irelan?­\nduring the· past century but has passed th~·ough tlus \ndining hall. Nearly every one of any emmence has \ndiscussed the burning questions of the day through all \nthose long years with his neighboul' across t~e t~bl~, \nbetween the soup and the snuff. And certamly 1t 1s \nsafe to say that at n_o other assembly in _Irela~d has each \nside of every question been heard so •mtelhgently and \nso good humouredly.

And the LEAD ER has \ncertainly stiffened the backs of the mere IrishPapi_sts and \nmade them realise that they have at least a nght to \nexist. You see evidences of this in the unlikeliest places. \nSome time since a Conservative candidate was con­\ntesting Stephen's Green.

Another \nsanctuary of legal reputation is the. dining ,hall· at \nKing 's Inns. At six: o'clock each evemng, what Byron \ncalls·\" the tocsin of the soul, the dinner bell\" sounds, \nand the bench, the bar and the budding barristers sit \ndown to dine. \nScarcely a man of any note in the history of Irelan?­\nduring the· past century but has passed th~·ough tlus \ndining hall. Nearly every one of any emmence has \ndiscussed the burning questions of the day through all \nthose long years with his neighboul' across t~e t~bl~, \nbetween the soup and the snuff. And certamly 1t 1s \nsafe to say that at n_o other assembly in _Irela~d has each \nside of every question been heard so •mtelhgently and \nso good humouredly.

It was quite \nfrightening\". \nOther injuries during the game occurred to Bell and Topping. \n\"Topping fractured his Collar bone after the second try and \nwill have to leave on Thursday. He's in a sling, the fracture \nisn't coo bad. Bell only has a hamstring problem so we'll give \nhim intensive treatment and hold on to him. Hopefully he will \nbe playing later in the test.\" \nApart from the injuries, things are going extremely well for \nthe team, according to Denise \"the morale is wonderful. .. the \ngame was great, anytime we had a chance for a cry we scored \n9 out of ten times.\" When asked what the victory could be \nattributed to Denise replied that \"the team have improved \nconsistently after each game this season and were unlucky not \nto have won any matches until now. On Saturday however \neverything came together - it was a great victory. There was a \nlarge Irish contingent at the game - Lansdowne RFC were \ntouring in the area at the time so they came to the match \nbefore going home . The Capetown Irish Club were shouting \non the team also\" \nWoody will be joining them on Saturday for the game in \nCapetown against the Western Province which promises to be \nanother extremely physical game - all the tickets are sold out \nahead of the game. \nThe team train each morning until midday and finish up for \nthe Mid day sun sets in. Speaking from the hotel in \nWilderness, Denise could tell us that the weather was great \neven though its the African Winter there at the moment . \n\"The part of Africa we're in for the first few games, is one of \nthe most beautiful regions in South Africa. We've been on one \nexcursion so far and that was when the team went up to the \ntop of Table mountain - that was amazing\" \nWhile the team are on a strict training regime they have been \nallowed out to shop and sight see etc. and with one member \nof the team, Dion O 'Cuinneagain, being from South Africa \nhimself the team are getting the inside track on everything \n\"its great because Dion is from Cape town where our first \nand third game are and where we are at the moment \n(Wilderness) is where he used to go on his holidays when he \nwas younger so he shows us the best places co go and every­\nthing\" \nAc the time of talking to Denise the team were busy prepar­\ning for their second and third matches.

The Reprise release My Way -The Best \nOf, \nwhich peaked at number 13 last year, looked \non course to climb around 30 places in the \nchart as two of the singer's Capitol albums, \n~ongs For Swingin' Lovers and Swing Easy, \nvied for a chart return. \n·i ./ • .. ,.-\nSales of a number of other Sinatra albums also picked up, as did his 1969 sin­\ngle My Way . But retailers say the public response has been more steady than \nwith previous big-name deaths because his death has been sadly anticipated \nfor some time and thus sales have stayed high for a couple of years. \nFaithless will be following their m illion-selling debut 'Reverence' w ith a new \nalbum, 'Sunday 8PM ', in September. Last week saw a two-track sampler, \n'Bring My Family Back'fShe's My Baby', mailed out as part of the run-up to \nthe new album. The two tracks on the sampler are decidedly downbeat, unlike \nhouse epics such as 'Insomnia' and 'Salva Mea ' wh ich helped the group sell \n4m singles world-wide. The first proper single release w ill be 'God Is The DJ', \nthe video for wh ich will be directed by group member Jamie Cato who recently \ndirected the video for Cheeky labelmate Skinny's single 'Failure'. The single is \none of the album's up tempo tracks but is apparently completely differen_t in \nsound to the group's previous hits. Faithless will be playing all of Europe's \nmajor festivals this summer including Glastonbury, Womad and V98 . \nAfter winning a Grammy award for Best Rock Instrumental (\"Block Rockin' \nBeats\"), electronica duo the Chemical Brothers are set to have their own label, \nFreestyle Dust, distributed by Caroline. Word is that the first releases will \nappear in the late summer . \nFor some reason the May/June period is when pop music starts to get good, \nor rather more of it and more poppy, kickstarting the summer into life as it \nwere and on this occasion our very own B*witched kick-start the charts into \ntw lw Title Artiste \n1 Feel It Tamperer \n2 C'est La Vie B•Witched \n• 3 2 Truly Madly Deeply Savage Garden , \n-- -+ 4 8 Sex on the Beach T-Spoan \n,-5 3 Under the Bridge All Saints \n~ ·=ti- /Lady Marmalade \n_ .. 6 4 Turn Back Time Aqua \n7 5 Gone 'Til November Wyclef Jean _l \n-~· ·-r 8 6 Dreams Corrs -r \n, • • Da\"\" ...

The single has been described by the record compa­\nny as Chumbawamba meets Aqua and that really sums it up perfectly, a \nswinging, bubbly Irish-flavoured pop song that bursts into a (quite sickly) jig \nduring the instrumental. It races to Number One a mile ahead of the competi­\ntion to give the group (two of whom are the twin sisters of Shane from \nBoyzone) an instant Number One with their first release. B*witched are in fact \none of only seven groups to \ngo straight to number 1 with a \ndebut track along with \nWhigfield, Robson & Jerome, \nBabylon Zoo and I haven't a \nclue who the rest of them \nare!

Ten tumultuous years, \nso,:ne gloriously high, some depressingly low, but \nwhile others of their ilk have foundered and fallen by \nthe wayside, the Jungle Brothers soldier on. In a \ngenre where many talk of longevity, but few attain \nthat level of durability, the Jungle Brothers have \nachieved just that without succumbing to passing \nfads that slide snake-like in and out of rap. They \nremain true to themselves and their beloved art. \nSo since De La Soul pulled there Cork show for the \nSouthern Soul and Disco Festival, the Jungle \nBrothers stepped in and replaced them, nice one \nlads. So we at Drop said to ourselves why not give \nMike G a ring in Los Angles and see what's up with \nthe Jungle Brothers .... \n\"We're family men now, and we realise what we do is \nconsequential, so we watch what we say and do. We \nrespect ourselves and others, but that doesn't mean \nwe have softened, on the contrary! We're new we're \nborn again. That vibe, that feeling that's present on \nthe new album isn't forced, it's totally natural. It runs \nright through us, on 'Raw Deluxe' there's spontaneity, \nthe moods, messages and beats all lock together.\" \nSo now that ten years have past for The Jungle \nBrothers, what does the future hold? \n\"When we're here another ten years from now, come \nsee us. That's what we're working towards. We're in \nthe middle of our careers, we still have a lot we want \nto do. We can think like that because we've come \nthrough a lot still standing, that comes from true \nfriendship.\" \nIt's your first visit to Ireland, do you find it more of a After the short phone call with Mike G , you can see \nchallenge to play in front of a crowd which is pre- that the Jungle Brothers are a lot more then just a \ndominately white and slightly naive to the hip-hop live group parading their ideas to sell-out audience's, \nscene? they are a group who have a love affair with music \n\"Ya know all types of music are out there to unite dif- and a passion that has driven them for the last ten \nferent types of people be it there colour, religion or years and hopefully the next ten around the world, \nsex and hip-hop is no different.

          "text": "Greetings to Soccer Rocker fans every­\nwhere!! I'm back .. back .. back!!! - Having \nserved my one match ban for bringing the \ngame into disrepute. So what's been going \non in my absence then?? \nOn the home front Limerick were eventually overcome by \nUCD in the Promotion/Relegation playoffs, though Ray \nO'Halloran's brilliant individual strike, which temporarily \nput us back on terms, gave us hope and no small amount of \njoy, but alas it just wasn't to be our day. Still it was great to \nsee such a large crowd down at Hogan Park and it would \nbe the very least our lads deserve if those numbers turned \nup on a regular basis next season. Well done to Dave \nO'Connell, Fran Mullally, the players and all the staff at \nLimerick FC for getting us this far. It's no mean achieve­\nment when you consider that this time last season Limerick \nwere well rooted to the bottom of the division with some \nfans uncertain as to whether we'd even be playing national \nleague football this season. \nNext season looks promising already with the likelihood of \nmore convenient Friday or Saturday kick offs for Limerick's \nhome games, to the potentially treacherous Sunday after­\nnoons where fixtures can clash with over hyped, frilly pack­\naged, half arsed crap that Sky Sports peddles as well as \nforcing Limerick to compete with our oh so popular Rugby \nClubs for punters. Anyone who's been to see Limerick \nplaying on the same day as a big local rugby match will tell \nyou that they didn't have to queue long for their half time \nmug of mushroom soup. The magic and wonder of Friday \nnight football is being brought to us courtesy of our infa­\nmous floodlights. Actually I'm not going to say anymore \nabout them as everytime I name a date by which they will \nbe up and running, twelve to eighteen months is added to \nthe time by which they arrive. Lets just all keep our fingers \ncrossed. \nSo here we are -mere days before the kick off of World \nCup 98 and as our boys in green will be watching this one \nin the pub, most of us Irish will probably be shouting for \nthe tartan army of Scotland and maybe also the Reggae \nBoyz of Jamaica. But make sure to tune in to see Yugoslavia \nwho are in Group F with Germany, Iran and the USA The \nYugoslavs will be among Ireland's opponents in the Euro \n2000 qualifiers which start in the Autumn. So will Croatia \nwho we play in our first game in September and you can \ncatch them in group H along side Argentina, Jamaica and \nJapan. It won't surprise me in the least if Croatia win that \ngroup. \nSo I hear you ask? Who are the surprise team of this tour-\nnament going to be? Who will win the Golden Boot? What \nbig teams are going home early? Where will the coveted \nWorld Cup be flown to in July? And where oh where will \nCameroon and Jamaica get their herbs man? Well as an \nunapologetic romantic who always roots for the underdog \nI hope the Scots have a good run and the Jamaicans too. I \nalso hope that whoever the hell wins won't have won it \nbefore and in that respect I'm going to put a few quid on \nHolland. \nLimerick's Albert Finnan makes an uncomfortable no non-\nsense tackle during the recent clash with UCO \nFrance being hosts as well as a fine football team would be \na reasonable bet for a first time winner though some host \nteams in the past have found the weight of expectation as \nmuch a burden as a help .... ltaly 1990, Spain 1982. \nReigning Champs Brazil have had an indifferent warm up \nwhich probably means they are going to win the damn \nthing, but Scotland couldn't have got them at a better time \nthan the opening game. Brazil seem to find the group \nstages of these things, tedious torrid affairs, where no hop­\ners like Scotland and Norway fight out their petty squalid \nquasi Kung fu tournaments in the fleeting hope of some­\nhow scraping through to the knock out stages where \nBrazil's collective heads are at long before a ball is kicked. \nIn such a situation it's more out of conviction than hope \nthat I could see the Scots take at least a point from Brazil. \nWe'll know soon enough .. Scotland play Brazil in the open­\ning game of France'98 at 3.30pm on Wed I 0th June.",

He's in a sling, the fracture \nisn't coo bad. Bell only has a hamstring problem so we'll give \nhim intensive treatment and hold on to him. Hopefully he will \nbe playing later in the test.\" \nApart from the injuries, things are going extremely well for \nthe team, according to Denise \"the morale is wonderful. .. the \ngame was great, anytime we had a chance for a cry we scored \n9 out of ten times.\" When asked what the victory could be \nattributed to Denise replied that \"the team have improved \nconsistently after each game this season and were unlucky not \nto have won any matches until now. On Saturday however \neverything came together - it was a great victory. There was a \nlarge Irish contingent at the game - Lansdowne RFC were \ntouring in the area at the time so they came to the match \nbefore going home . The Capetown Irish Club were shouting \non the team also\" \nWoody will be joining them on Saturday for the game in \nCapetown against the Western Province which promises to be \nanother extremely physical game - all the tickets are sold out \nahead of the game. \nThe team train each morning until midday and finish up for \nthe Mid day sun sets in. Speaking from the hotel in \nWilderness, Denise could tell us that the weather was great \neven though its the African Winter there at the moment . \n\"The part of Africa we're in for the first few games, is one of \nthe most beautiful regions in South Africa. We've been on one \nexcursion so far and that was when the team went up to the \ntop of Table mountain - that was amazing\" \nWhile the team are on a strict training regime they have been \nallowed out to shop and sight see etc. and with one member \nof the team, Dion O 'Cuinneagain, being from South Africa \nhimself the team are getting the inside track on everything \n\"its great because Dion is from Cape town where our first \nand third game are and where we are at the moment \n(Wilderness) is where he used to go on his holidays when he \nwas younger so he shows us the best places co go and every­\nthing\" \nAc the time of talking to Denise the team were busy prepar­\ning for their second and third matches.

          "text": "NEW RELEASES \nTHERAPY? - \" Lonely, Cryin' Only\" \nThe return of Therapy? in the last two months, after \na short break, has been low key to say the least. One of \nIreland's most consistent performers of the nineties, \nthey returned in March with a critically acclaimed album \nentitled 'Semi Detached', and this single is the second \nto be lifted from the aforementioned. \nA change in line-up and a recuperation period after \nfive year of constant work was meant to be the spur for \nAndy Cairns and the boys to re-launch themselves on the \nIrish music scene with a bang. Unfortunately it hasn't \n.., I ,>. • \n•. •ct- '· .• -.. ' \n--~~ . • \n,, \nI \nreally worked out that way and the new album and subse­\nquent single have been and gone without to much atten­\ntion been paid. This single will probably follow in its pre­\ndecessors footsteps, but really it deserves more than \nthat. ' Lonely, Cryin' Only' is typical Therapy?, fast, loud \nand brisk at just over two and a half minutes. The open­\ning 15 seconds are innovative, a telephone ringing, and \nan answering machine telling us to \" leave a message or \nleave me alone\", leading into a Pixie-esque intro. \nThe rest is unmistakeable Therapy?, and their dis­\ntinctive sound has perhaps hindered the progression in \nan age where bands are perceived as being unimaginitive \nif they release too singles that sound alike. However \nTherapy? are not really bothered about fame and fortune \nat this stage. They will continue to do what they are \ndoing, and I'm sure their many fans will enjoy this record \nas much as their other releases. ( 7 /10 ) \nLIMERICK LIVE \nCRUSH -The Warehouse, May 21st. \nIf fast and furious power pop is your sort of thing, then \nwhy on earth weren't you in The Warehouse on May 21st. \nCrush treated the small, but enthusiastic crowd to a set of \na well crafted, confident songs that everyone seemed to get \noff on. \nHaving recently been very impressed by their demo, \nthe Dublin trio certainly lived up to my expectations. Right \nfrom opener 'Candy', they exuded a confidence and fluency \nnot often evident in a band in existence just under a year. ( \nThis could be attributed to previous experienced gained by \nRobbie Callan and Keith Walker in well publicised Dublin out­\nfit 'Power of Dreams' ). \ndrop21 \nTheir ability to turn slow, sublime verses into choruses \nthat makes you want to loose it (as in ' Only This') is quiet \nbrilliant, and each member seems to be perfectly in tune, \naccumulating in songs that sound just right. Highlights \nincluded the rip-roaring 'Somedays Control' and 'World turns \nAround', definite single material should the deserved oppur­\ntunity arise. \nCallan informed me that the band are jetting off \nStateside on June the 1st to follow up on some exciting \ninterest expressed since their last trip in March. Manager, \nDave Egan, has been in contact with Mike Judge, the cre­\nator of T.V's most open-minded music critics Beavis and \nButthead, and current hit 'King of the Hill' and the prospect \nof exposure on either show is a possibility. \nSpending time in America will do Crush no harm as \nthe Yanks are suckers for fast paced, melodious guitar \nmusic as bands like Everclear, Our Lady's Peace and Third \nEye Blind will testify. \nThe futures so bright, Crush should be wearing shades . \nLimerick Band in Fanning Sessions \nVeneer have recently been in \nDublin, there to meet with their \nlatest fan-Dave Fanning. Last \nweek the band took the trip to \nDonnybrook, Dublin 4, where \nthey met up with Peter Holidai \nwho produces the Fanning ses­\nsions (also co-produced \nJunsksters album), Jim Lockard \n(produces Fannings show) and \nDave Fanning. They spent the \nday recording a number of \nsongs to be featured on \nFanning's radio show shortly. \nThe band have just played their \nfirst live performance in months in Costellos last Sunday. \nThe reason for their absence from the live scene is that they \nhave been busy recording and writing new material. The \nband have set up their own studio so they never leave the \nhouse now!! A new single is due out in the Autumn com-\nplete with accompanying video. Interest in the band is said \nto be high. They have been making ears turn since their \ndebut EP in 1996 and after winning last year's Green Energy \nBands competition the band have enjoyed an increased \nrespect within the music industry. Keep a listen out for \nthem and their debut on Fannings sessions is due for \nMonday June 8th and a repeat two weeks later. \ni \nOFFER AVAIIABlE FOR A UMITTD PERIOD ONLY \n· . ~ ,:;t.\"=\" INTERNET TRAINING-INTERNET ACCESS \n• • THOMAS STREET LIMERICK 061 312066 \nInternet cafe £5:00 PER HOUR £2:50 PER HA~F HOUR \nr------------------, \nI I \nI I \nI HALF AN HOUR FREE 1 I I \n: INTERNET l \n: WITH EVERY ONE HOUR : \n: PURCHASED : \nI I \nI WITH THIS VOUCHER 1 \nL------------------~",

I must say that from the reaction of the audience any \nanxiousness was soon to be dispelled. An array of colours, materials \nand designs was to follow; Karen Flannery's gold and purple puffa \nbeach creation; Jennifer Whitty's golden shiny \"I dream of Genie\" \nlook; Mandy O 'Loughlin's Egyptian dancer. Notice a common theme/ \nNext up we have the 3rd year Diploma designs for the Limerick \nCharter 800 competition. The medieval creations would have felt \nquite at home at one of the Bunratty banquets. The designs of Joan \nHickson gained her I st prize. Joanne Hynes was another student \nwhose medieval rock punk style made quite an impression. Her col­\nlection represents the \"Anti-established dress codes for those who \ndeliberately dress morally incorrect\". \nLiam Greer's emerald shimmer 3/4 length dress was the envy of \nevery fashion conscious individual present. This particular design also \ncame I st place in the Heineken Colour in Your Life competition. \nAnother event which brought the LCAD students creativity and style \nto the fore was the Ponds Models for Charity competition held back \nin December 97 in the RDS . The designs encapsulated glamour and \nall that it represents. The designs ranged from a Jackie O' look from \nLaura Doyle; a Boogie Nights catsuit creation from Catherine \nMcDonagh entitled \"Mould Breakers\"; Niamh Lynch's black sequinned \nswingy look to a demure and Lady Like Lilac collection from Grainne \nPhealan; A witty collection from Alan Kelly \"36-26-36\" {I wish!} \nwhose period of work experience with acclaimed International cat­\nwalk· designer Vivienne Westwood s'eemed to be time well spent; and \nMargaret Condren's floaty dreamy look shown to the haunting \n\"Teardrop\" melody by Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraiser. \nThe Degree show finished the evening with a rapturous applause and \na standing ovation The individuality of each creation was a pleasure \nto behold, not knowing what was next to come. What did appear \nwas \"Warhol's Sisters\" from Hirsten French - Blessed are the avant-\ngarde for they shall inherit the earth. A\"luvvly jubbly\" collection \nfrom Louise Kennedy {good name} described as Delboy's Day Out, \nhumour and attitude. Oran Hallinan's \"DS7-!\" collection was based \non the Seven Deadly Sins and their depictions on the body. His use \nof colour and contrast reflected the eerie mood of the collection \nand unspoken taboos. Riona Cronin's \"Amythyest Flow\" won her \nmost Creatively Commercial collection. Full of myth and romance in \nmisted hues of purple and plum with floating textures of semi-trans­\nparent chiffon and knit. \nThe finale of the evening was this year winner of the Smirnoff Young \nDesigner competition Michelle Molloy. \"No frills\" but just a few \nthrown in, along with rubber wetsuits and lemon ballerina tutu's. \nWhere do the ideas stem from? \nCongratulations to all and many thanks for a spectacular show. See \nmost of you next year.",

This is encouraging for all the talented unknown bands out \nthere who will still feel it worthwhile to get their tracks on demo and \nhope they will be the lucky ones. \nCrush's demo was very well presented and the production was of very \nhigh quality. This three piece comprising of Robbie Callan Vinnie Ryan \nand Keith Walker also put together three impressive tracks that definite­\nly leave a lasting impression. The opening track \"Control\" is excellent. \nA high tempo'd track full of barraging guitar work which hos a memo ­\nrable chorus. Callan has a very wide ranging voice and the instru­\nments all compliment each other. The second song on the demo is \nquite different \"Radio Telescope\" slows things right down with harmo­\nnious backing vocals and a memorable guitar solo. The final track \n\"Only this\" is in my view the pick of the three songs. It processes a \nvery imaginative soundscape and a lyrical substance not apparent on \nthe previous tracks. It balances slow and rhythmical verses with a loud \nand abrasive chorus with ease. \nMy only criticism is that the tracks do sound very alike in places and \nan album of such material may become monotonous. Overall though it \nis a highly impressive start for Crush and one which they can build on. \nFor anyone who missed them in the Warehouse or who saw them and \nwant to see them again pop into Bruxelles in Dublin the next time \nyou're there as they play a regular spot there (Mondays I think, not \nsure ring in advance -word is they are touring outside of the country \npretty shortly). - 8/10 \nHANRATTY\"S \nEXCLUSIVE \nNITE CLUB \nDANCE 60's, \n70's, 80's. \nHANRATTY'S HOTEt;. \nGLENTWORTH ·STREET \n(061) 410999 \nIRISH MUSIC \nliHURSDAY NIGHli \nF.RIDAY NIGHJ \npr:oduct product \n1nd1e kids \nOne to Watch \nThe Hormones - \"Don't let them get you down\" \nWe 've heard time and again that to make it big in the music world you \nneed a lot of luck and then some more. Based in London like a lot of \nour best mus icians intent on making it big, The Hormones ·have just got \ntheir slice of the luck cake. While recording the soon to be seen wed­\nding episode in London -the cast of friends decided they needed a \nband to be part of the episode -and who did they pick but the \nHormones -a band creating a lot of interest amongst record compa­\nnies in England and further a field at the moment . Being one of the \nworld's most popular shows in the Friends had the ability to tum the \nRembrandts into a multi million selling band, so the Hormones have to \nbe excited by the possibilities. \nThis, their current single, will probably do well in the next couple of \nweeks but is it really good? The Hormones music is bright breezy \nmaterial full of melodious harmonies and chirpy rhythm guitars. The \nlyrics of \"Don't let them get you down\" although not the song sang in \nfriends is suited to Friends-its almost as if it was written for the show \n\"You want to have your friends to be friends to the end then forever\" \nThe single is definitely long summer evening music.

We here at Drop are \nputting our faith in the other boys in green \n(and gold), Jamaica, and we think you should \ntoo . The boys from the Caribbean, have qual­\nified for the World Cup for the first time and \nrather like us Irish back in 1990 they have \nbrought their \n,.......,,..'.'-\"\"\"\".,....-:--:--;:-,.,.,--...,.,• home nation \nto a standstill. \nAfter qualify­\ningfor the \nWorld Cup \nfrom the \nConcacaf \nregion along \nwith Mexico \nand the U.S. \nthey declared \na national hol­\niday and cele­\nbrated!!!! \nRather than \nthrow our weight behind one of the obvious \nfavourites like Brazil or Germany, or pledge \nour allegiance to home nations England or \nScotland, the Reggae Boyz are the obvious \nchoice. After all they spent centuries under \nEnglish rule just like ourselves, and also they \nare another country where your search for a \nsnake would be in vain. So I'm sure Saint \nPatrick, and of course Bob Marley, will be giv­\ning their full vocal support when watching the \nWorld Cup from upstairs. \nTheir Jack Charlton figure is one Rene \nSimoes, a Brazilian who was persuaded to \ntake the job after seeing John Candy's heroic \nefforts with the Jamaican bobsleigh team in \n\"Cool Runnings\". He has had amazing suc­\ncess with the Reggae Boyz. since he took over \nand has guided them to No.31 in the world \nrankings, that's 43 places higher than when he \ntook charge. He also, like Big Jack, doesn't \nnecessarily play an all born Jamaican team. \nHe has drafted in English born players Frank \nSinclair, Robbie Earle, Marcus Gayle and \nDeon Burton in recent times, so if you follow \nthe Premiership you know some of the faces \non the team. \nDROP will be keeping updates on the team \nand their exploits in France over the next num­\nber of issues. In the meantime go out and get \nthe gear (football that is) for the team and start \npractising your chants ... Come on Jam-aic-a!!!!",

Ireland have many talented players and I hope the selectors keep faith with them for the W orld Cup . We have not played up our potential on the international front. Ap art from the English games over the past two years. We were gallant losers in Australia, 'but then, we have always managed to go down fighting. I think that the National side would do far better if they appointed just one man as managr. Willie Anderson would be my choice and let him pick the side and decide on the team's game plan. The Irish soccer team under Jack _sharlton has been proof of this system. England, New Zealand and Australia h avealso cut their selectors to three with the Manager and Coach calling the shots. Irish rugby is not as bad as many people paint it but if te structure at the top is lacking then the team will continue to suffer.",

Bringing \ntogether four of Ireland's most recognised mu sicians, the idea was \nto allow audiences a taste of the favoured - if somewhat outwardly \nop posin g - mu sical styles that have influenced Irish m usic as we \nknow it today. It worked . Yet indeed, with bluesman Don Baker, \naward-winning country songwriter, M ick H anly and Jimmy \nMcC~rth y, possibly lreland 's most prolific contemporary Irish \nsongwriter claiming penned classics such as 'No Frontiers', 'Ride 0 11 ' \nand 'Katie', joining forces with the country's original purveyor of \nIrish trad', Finbar himself, how could it not ? \n\"We 've had a terrific response so far,\" claims Finbar, \"and we 've \nbeen really enjoying it as well. A s well as getting the chance to put \nour own music on stage, there's a lot of craic in w hat we're doing. \nAs they say -'boys will be boys' and~ boys will be real boys 1\" \nTt is quite obvious from talking to him that Fmbar Furey is a m an \nvery content with the life that he's reached. To count the years, it \nmay be a far cry from the-days when he and brother Eddie, were \nthe first to put a 12 string guitar and a set of oileann pipes together, \na far cry from the days when , as yo ung sters of a trad' scene that \nincluded the D11bli11ers, tl,e Clancy Bro/1,ers and l/1e C!,ieftnins, they \nwere given more than a few guest session spots, yet it's a life that \nhasn't veered from it's original track : Since the Fureys very first \nrecordi~g was played on British radio's Joh n Peel show in 1969, \nFinbar is still playing, still sessioning and still a trad' man at heart. \n\"I don 't feel any older. I'm still 20 years of age and I'm continuing \nwriting songs. I think the m inute yo u lose that you might as well \nthrow in the towel.\" \nW ith a da ughter, Aine, and a son, Martin, at the m omen t touring \nNorway with their band Bohinta, he does, howeve r, pity the youn g \nup -and-comin g Irish ballad players. \n\"It was very hard for us (the Fu reys) to get started but it's even \nharder now for yo ung bands and shame on the country for that. In \nour day it'was great because we had a lot of Irish m usic played on \nthe radio. Irish band s aren't given nearly enough of the airtim e now \nthat they need to succeed . Th ink of the Cranberries, for instance, \nwh o had to go away to mak e their w ay. No bod y knew of them -\nnever.even heard of them in Ireland - until all of a sudd en they're \nFrom Top L to R : Don Balter, Flnbar Furey, Mick Hanly and Jimmy McCarthy \n... bac k on the road \nin the Ameri can charts.\" \nH e isn't, however, too worried about his own childrens' musical \nfuture, singing their praises as only a father can. Ye t:·at the same \ntime, when that father happens to be Finbar Furey,_ you're inclined \nto take the eulogies that little bit more seriously. \n\"they've been wo rking around Ireland for the last few years and \nwe re finding it hard to get anything so they had to ·move out. But \nagain, wandering around the world isn't going to oo ·t_hem any \nharm either. They 're great musicians. The y. have there own imagi­\nnations and are not trying to walk in my foot_steps. Th ey're on a \ntotally different sort of trip with the music than I .am. :ou know, \nthey have the trad' roots but they're very contemporary.\" \nHe 's quick t; point out that wit!-\\ Aine boasting a first class degree \nin Celtic Studies and Martin a B.A. from Trinity College i_n History \nand languages, they - like there father -are pl<lying mu sic, \n\"because they love it. Because it's in them \". \nAs for the bould Finbar, his future continues on a much clearer \npath. Playing a sellout tour in Scotland's Na tional'Concert Hall, \nGlasgow, last M ond ay (16 Jar:i) w ith brothers and guest artist \nDolores Keane, and with a series of late January dates across \nIreland with the Four for the Road tour, his summer calender is also \nbooked up . The Fureys will be playng China and a first ever con­\ncert in South Africa. Until then, he'll be working on a solo album \nand his new book, already titled 'remember me l\\:ow'. \n\"I guess if I wasn't playing mu sic I'd .be either in the pub dodging \nthe guards or writing fulltime !\" he laughs. \"That's it really : W hen \nI get fed up with the pipes I lay them down and pick up the pen ; \nwhen I get fed up with the pen I start writing songs. But I think that \nif I was to ever really get fed up. ,;_,ith writing songs then it ·wo uld \nonly be because they we 're pt1tting me in a box and carting m e \naway! \" • .•. . \n(The FOUR FOR THE ROA£?

      "chunk_text": "Ape Invasion \nIn Somalia it has been report­\ned that a schoolboy football \nteam had to abandon a match \nafter a pitch invasion. \nUnfortunately the invasion was­\nn't of ecstatic fans but of mad \nmonkeys. Witnesses said the \nmonkeys invaded the pitch in \nBurao town and attacked the \nplayers, biting and scratching \nyoungsters on the legs.The \ntown of Burao is home to as \nmany monkeys as it is people, \nduring Somalia's Civil war \nloads of the monkeys took over \nderelict buildings with the result \nthat some parts of Burao are \nnow home to colonies of \nMonkeys. The Monkey invasion \nof the pitch is not unusual in \nthe area and armed police \nwere on hand to disperse the \nprimates. The monkeys would­\nn't relent until their ring leader \nwas shot dead by police marks­\nmen!!. \nRussia Frenzy for Fish bait \nBarbie! \nIn Far Eastern Russia, fisher­\nmen have now begun a frenzy \nof purchasing Barbie dolls!! Not \nbecause they have just begun \nto find their sensitives sides or \nbecause US consumerism has \ngotten a grip of them but \nbecause their hair makes good \nfish bait! Fishermen have been \nbuying up Chinese-made \nBarbie dolls and using their \ngolden hair as bait. Some \nFishermen have been quoted \nas saying that the hair is very \npopular with the local fish. The \nproblem for the US manufactur­\ners is that they are not cashing \nin on the fad because the \nFishermen are not purchasing \nI \noriginal products but rather \ncheap imitations from China. \nCat shortage puts rats on the \nmenu \nIn Vietnam the population is \nbeing instructed to stop eating \nCats and switch ... to eating rats. \nA Irish reader who 's used to the \nbacon, cabbage and spuds may \nfind it hard to comprehend but in \nother parts of the world where \nspuds and bacon are not as \ncommon and people wouldn't \ndare eat cabbage -small ani­\nmals are the only option. The \ncat meat trade in Vietnam is a \ngrowing trade and even within \nVietnam the export trade of cats \nto China is becoming a lucrative \nbusiness, That was until the \ngovernment outlawed the eating \nof Cats so as to prevent an over \nrun of rats in the region. It \nappears as if the country was \nsuffering from an excessive \nnumber of rats running freely in \nthe city. This is leading to the \ndestruction of many harvests \nand the agriculture section is \nsuffering badly so now with the \neating of cats outlawed many of \nthe countries natives are turning \nto the plentiful supply of Rats to \nnourish themselves. The eating \nof rats is already common prac­\ntice so the transition from cats \nto rats will not be so hard felt. \nVery Cold Turkey \nTwo young romantics in Turkey \ngot a hard taste of reality when \ntheir elopement went tragically \nwrong. The couple Reis Mergen \nand girlfriend Ali Dogan were \nfleeing from their families in the \nname of love, however what \nthey didn't bank on was ending \nITTews \nup together in a hospital bed \nminus hands and feet -not \neven able to hug each other. \nWhat happened wasn't some \nTurkish law that made elope­\nment punishable by amputation \nof hands and feet but rather in \nthe escape attempt the couple \nended up fleeing across the \ncountry side on foot (later to be \nlost). Unfortunately for the duo \nheavy snow began to fall and \nthey were later discovered by \npolice and found to be suffering \nfrom severe hypothermia and \nfrostbite. Reports say that tem­\nperatures reached minus thirty \ndegrees and as a result of the \nfrost bite the two are facing \namputation of their hands and \nfeet -wh ich will make their next \nelopement that little bit more \ndifficult. \nDOG to be Hung \nIn Tanzania a dog has been \ngiven the death penalty as a \nresult of a highly unusual case \nbrought before the courts. \nBefore the court was a dog \nnamed \"Immigration\" and its \nowner. The crime was that of \nscandalising the name of the \ndepartment of Immigration in \nTanzania. The court heard how \nthe 25 year old owner of the \ndog made regular trips to the \nImmigration department in \nTanzania were he criticised \npeople working their and boast­\ned about how he had named \nhis dog after them. The man \nw~o ha? _a long standing gripe \nwith officials in the East African \ns~ate was found guilty and \ngiven a suspended sentence \nbut his dog was given a far \nworse fate -the death penalty.",

On his playlist for this show Fanning ex plains that due lo a short­\nage of music videos in the RTE music library his choices are limited \n\"Theres an awful lot of videos that we don't hav e, the RTE video library is \nnot as strong as it probably should be. I m ea n to be blunt because it's the \nnational station every video should be there. but the Irish record compa­\nnies, it has to come through them but they are mor e or less the subsideries \nof British record companies so they 're the little brothers, I me an if \nEngland sneezes we catch a co ld. So we ha ve to take what we get so there's \na few programmmes feeding off it including N o Disco, The Den and to be \nblunt videos get lost. .. \nWid ely regarded as the Mu sic Guru of Ireland Fanning is probably the \nmo st frequently quoted person on press releases from up and coming \nband s. So who doe s he think is good and who is his favourite band . DROP \nput it to him that they heard that\" My Bloody Valentine\"was his favourite \nband , ''My Bloody Valentine are not my favourite band at all, I saw them \nlive and I would hone stly say they were the wor st band I've seen live in my \nlife but they released ''Isn't anything'' in about '88 and then they released \n\"Loveless\" in '91 and \"Loveless\" would be in my top ten albums of all time, \nI ab solutely love \"Loveless\" - but they certainly wouldn't be my favourite \nband or anything like that at all A s I say when I saw them live once they \nhad this one thing that they did, it wa s a nine minute sonic noise thing and \nit doe sn 't serve any purpo se other than to seriously iritate and you might \nsay \"but oh that's a statement that's performance art·• it' s not ! i 1 • s b o II ox ! \nit's nonsense! I thought they were rubbish live.'' \nSo what about other band s what will become of former Stone Ro ses front \nman Ian Brown ... \n\"Ian Brown is not as much a mu sician -he's the one who might suffer \nmo st. .. I know the first Stone Ro ses album the songs were Squire/Brown but \nI don 't know how much Brown put in, but Squire w as the music obviously \nso he's able to do stuff and maybe the Seahorses stuff is a bit wimpy an d \nwatery but there's still good songs there - I can well understand fans of \nStone Roses hating Seahorses I kinda like the Seahorses. I find the lead \nsinger a bit wishy washy but well lets see what happen s maybe he ' II get a \nyou might say \"but oh that's a stateme,it that's \nperformance art\" it's ,iot! it's ho/lox! \nbit of edge to him .. ehm what was the question again ... - Oh yeah his album \nhe felt he had to do something he was Ian Brown and he had to do some­\nthing he had a ten point start on anyon e else making a first solo album , in \nother words people were going to listen to it. .. he is not nessesarily a major \nmusician and even when he was singng with stone Roses he wasn't even a \ngreat singer\" \nSo finally we asked Dave the question on everybody's lips; who's going to \nbe big in 98 .... \n\"People keep asking me that.. I just don't know - everytime I recommend a \nband they break up by Christmas and they're back in the dole queues . I'm \nlooking forward to the \"lmbrace\" album just to see if they can deliver but I \ncould change my mind next week .

MAY 6, 1905. \nThe_ N a_tion.~i Assurance collapse is a dreadful \ncalamity; it will probably bring · ruin to the doors of \nmany of the unfortunate shareholders who have now \nnot only lost all their invested money but who \n~vill be called upon to pay up an amount not yet known \nto m~et the expenses of_ winding up this disastrous en­\nterpns_e. And such nice, respectable names figured on \nthe. d~rectorate ! 80 many of them real, genuine \nUmomsts, too! Aud one of them Frederick C Pilk­\nington, D.L., J.P., is a director ol the Great So~thern \nand w·estern Railway, in which so many widows, \norphans? and struggling people have their money, and \nover which a real baronet presides. It is certainly pru­\ndent that the shareholders of the G. S. & W. Co. should \nlook around them and before them. \nIn view of the terrible fate of the National Assurance· \nCo., the shareholders of the G. S. and W. Railway \nought to be thankful to those ene1·getic gentlemen who \nhave moved in the matter of that Railway. The direc­\nt~rs of the G. S. and W. ·Railway are all men bearing \nhighly-respectable names, just as do the directors of the \nNational Assurance Co .; indeed, one of the directors \nof the ill-fated and utterly mis-managed National As­\nsurance Co. is also on the Board· of the G. S. and V·l. \nRailway of depreciated profits. It is· well to take these \nthin&s in time, and whilst thei:e is something to save \nand improve ; the shareholders of the National As­\nsurance Co. have nothing to do now but in addition to \nbearing the complete loss of their invested capital, pay \nup whatever additional call that may be made upon \nthem. The shareholders of the G. S. and W. Railway \nhave a valuable asset, though a considerably depreciated \none to look after; and if they are sensible they will \nlook after it. -\nThe Chairman and Directors of the G . S. and W . \nRailway have been served with the following notice:­\n\" TAKE NOTICE that we, the undersigned twenty or \nmore, Stockholders in the Great Southern and Western \nRailway Company of Ireland, holding in the aggregate \nstoc~ to tne amount of fifty thousand pounds, do hereby \nrequire y.ou, the Chairman and Directors, of the said \nC~mpany to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of \nsaid Company for the-purposes and objects following, \n.that is to say:-\nIn a circular sent out to Shareholders signed by the \nHon. Secretaries of the Committee, Mr. M. Sullivan, \nLL.B., and Mr. Donohoe, J.P., the following grave \nstatement--a statement that in view of the colfapse of \nthe National Assurance Co., should be carefully con­\nsidered by every shareholder in the Company-is set \nout : -\" In 1897 and previous years the Great Southern \nand Western Railway paid 5 and 5½ per cent'. Dw·ing \n1898, 1899, and 1900 it paid 5 per cent. In 190\n1\n1 the \ndividend. fell to 3 per cent, and it has never since reached_ \n4 per cent. In 1904 tho dividend for the June half-yea!' \nwas 3}, and for the Decei:nber half-year 3il-that is, 3~ \nfor the whole year. \nThe falling off from even 5 per cent. to 3~ per cent. \nmeans a falling off of £1 7s. Gel. in the yearly income \nfrom each £100· of Stock. As the total amount of \n\" Ordinary Stock.,, is over 5 millions (£5,325,520), the \nreduction of the Ordinary Shareholders' yearly income \namounts to the large sum of £73,225. \nWill the dividends go lower? Will the Great Sou them \nfollow those Irish Railways which pay 3 per cent. or \nless If so, how will Preference Shares, Debentures, \nand the borrowing pqwer of our Company be affected ? \nOr , would it not be possible ·so to manage that the \n' good old times ' of 5 and 5½ per cent. might come \nback ? The Great Northern pays 6½ and 6if. \nLook at the matter in another way. So recently as \n1898 Great Southern Shares were 147½. The market \nvalue is now (Ma rch, 1905) 92¼-a fall of over 55. Th e_ \nmarket value at present is under 5 millions-a falling \noff in value of nearly 3 millions of pounds. No doubt \nsome of this reduction in value should be set down to the \ngeneral depreciation caused by the expenditure on the \nBoer War, but even allowing 20, for this general de­\np~·eciation, how are the remaining 35 points of reduc­\ntion to· be accounted for? It is not sufficient to say \nthat the ' Amalgamation ' caused this fall · in Stocli:­\nvalue? In June, 1900', the Directors 'congratulated'. \nthe Shareholders on the passing of· the Amalgamation \nAc~s, but although the Amalgamation has proved a \nfruitful source of loss, no one has yet shown that it \naccounts for the whole depreciation in the vaiue of \n' Ordinary Stock.' \" \n1.

Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once.

As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

If the \nDe~artm~nt employed a~1 e~pert, surely it was some­\none_ a busmess _to see he did his duty and attended to his \n~usmes~. ~~is, h?wever, is one of the weakest points \nm the admmistration of the Agricultural Boa rd. They \nseem _ to have no system of in~pection in the Depart­\nmen~at lea:;it, no competent mspection-to see that \nthe lect~r~rs and technical instructors are kept to theil' \nwork faithfully and according to their agreements. The \nle?turers and experts seem to be left to their own sweet \nwill. _While, of c~urs~, a~ expert or a specialist is not \nt? be mterfered with m his routine work , at the sam e \n. time some sort of supervision should be in force to see \n.t~_at du~ks and dra~es were . not made of an important \nt~ 1al. w hi?h at ~~e. time Pa,rhamen t was being moved to \ngive special facilities to, and which the Ohancellor of the \nExchequor, badgered and cornered by the Irish M em­\nbers, and some of the leading people in the tobacco \ntrade, at la.st . consented to give what practically \na~nounted to a big bounty to encourage the experiment. \n~t would al:'pear the experiment in that year was re­\nstricted _to a little over an acre, the place selected being \na plot m th~ ground of the Munst er Institute a few \nm~les outside Cork. The soil was admirable'. The \nIrish: plants were strong and healthy ones-better than \nthe imported French ones. The ground was heavily \n~anured, and the c~op gave an early promise of being a \nbig success. But it turned out an absolute failure. \nWhy was it not a success 1 Was it properly attended \nto?· Tobacco-growing requires almost the attention of \na _flower-gai·den. Was the crop even weeded 1 In short, \ndid ~he expert who had o_nly this small plot really attend \nto his duties 1 The Agncultu_ral Depa rtment t~ll us in \ntheir report for that year:- \" Much damage was done to \nthe crop by rooks.\" Sw-ely such an a·ccident could \nhave been prevented. Here was a crop raised artifi­\ncially: Some of the plants actually imported \nat great expense from France. Yet a small boy \nwith a pair of clappers, or an old man with a flint-lock \nmusket could not be employed at a shilling a day to pro­\ntect .such a valuable crop from the crows. Did it come \nto the knowledge of the Department that matters at the \nl\\funstet Institute farm-and we believe it did-were \nbe1ng sadly neglected? Surely this was a case of losing \n. the sheep for a pennyworth of tar. \n· Further, when the leaf-crop was gathered in, or as \nmqch of it as the French .expert chose to collect, no \neffort seems to have been made to give the crop a fair \nchance of being cured. AJ,, the Agricultural Depart­\nment report says:-\" In drying the crop_~n !),ttempt was \nmade to dispense with a costly house and heating appa­\nratus. A rough, wooden shed· was therefore er~cted -in \nthe field, and there the leaves were dried, ·and then they' \nwere removed to a barn in which a coke stove supplied \nthe necessary heat .. \" After such a rude attempt at cur-· \ning the plants much could not be expected. We might \nask, was the expert restricted in his attempts to cure the \nplants 'by having imperfect tools? 0i· did anyone see \nwh _at he was attempting·to do ? Or, and we ask the ques­\ntion. again, w.as the Department informed or aware of \n_ the negl!icted state of affairs? -.But let us quote the De-\n., pai;tment's repoi,t itself:-\" A special expert is required \n.to superintend the fermentation of tobacco, ancl, in­\nstead _of procuring an officer from abroad for this pur­\npose, the leaves were sent to Paris with the object of \nhaving them fermented in the Government factory \n• there. tr nfortunaiely considerable difficulty arose in \nhaving the tobacco transferred from the Custom House \non its arrival in France. Delays occuri-ed, and when \nthe. tobacco eventually arrived at the Government fac-• \ntory, it bad greatly deteriorated owing to the absorption \nof moisture.\" The fact really was, no attempt had been \nmade by the Department to obtain the free entry of the \nleaf with the French Custom House people, and the \nleaves lay exposed and sodden at Dieppe for some t]il-ee \nweeks bcfoi·e the necessary per~it was obtained. \n• \"BUY NAVAN BACON AND HA.MS. BEST ON \nTHE MARKET.\" \n\" Ask for it and see that you get it.\" \n\"Bold by a.II leading Purveyon.\" \nThe Agricultural Department's report ends here.- But \nthere is a sequel. They do not tell us what was the end \nof ~his costly experiment, the result of a four years' \ntri~l, and the product .of a highly-paid expert speci~lly \nbrought over from Paris. The tobacco leaves, we be­\nlieve, when they reached the Paris Government factory, \nwere in such a rotten condition owing to the delays in \ntransit, and the wretched way in which they were \npacked, that they had to be thro.wn out on the manure \nheap and burned. Such was the ending of this costly \nexperiment. Incompetence, neglect, and carelessness \nall round . \nNow, we do not wish to be too hard on the Technical \nDepartment ; but.if this is a sample of the work done by \nit, it is a sorry exhibition of carelessness, neglect, and \nindifference, not to mention wanton waste. of money \nwhich was-and is so-sadly wanted in other ways. -There \nshould be some system of inspection or, overlooking \nwhich would prevent such a fiasco as this. If it,had \nbeen the first or second year of the tobacco -experiment \nit might be condoned, but at the end of the fourth \nyear's trials, taking the most charitable view of the \nm atter, such incompetence and neglect deserve severe \ncensure on those who direct and control--or affect to do \nso-such matters. In my next article I shall deal with \nlast year's experiment and other m atters, which show \nthe Agricultural Department is taking a rather strange \nview of its rights and privileges in connection with \ntobacco culture and curing. \nR.H. 0. \nTHE YERDICT OF THE MANUFACTURI BS. \n'f HIS week we pu~lish a third batch of interesting \nletters from Insh m anufacturers concerning the \nas-good-and-as-cheap policy.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

That 'article which appeared 'in our issue of \nNovember 10th, 1900, was on Boots. We frnd, on \nreferring back to it, that our appr~ximate calculation, \nassuming that all the leather used m the boots had 'to \nbe imported-and as a matter of fact that was not, or is \nnot, so-was that about £800,000• a year would go to \nshoeing the population of Ireland. Our information \nat the time was t4at not one-tenth of that sum was \nkept in the country, or in other words, that £720,000 \nwas lost to it because Ireland did not shoe itself. • Since \nthen a considerable improvement has be~n effected .. \nWinstanley's is the largest boot factory in Ireland, and \nin our Christmas Number, December, 190·3, they an­\nnounced that they employed over 300 workers in their \nfactory, and found that number insufficient to execute \nall orders, and added, \" skilled labour urgently l·e­\nquired.\" The Lee B'oots, of Cork; Hearn and Cahill, \nof \\V'aterford; Williamson's, of Belfast, no doubt also \nconsiderably expanded their output; but in view of our \napproximate calculation four and a half years ago, that \neven assuming that Ireland imported all the leather \nused in the boots made-which she does n-ot, and the \ntanning industry is capable of great development--that \nthe country paid to foreign makers £720>,000 annually \non the head of ·boots, there is a great margin left to be \nworked upon. There is a good deal of picking on \n£720 ,000· a year, and notwithstanding the considerable \nadvance that has been made in the way of the Irish \nconsumers giving up playing the fool by supporting \nforeign boots when Irish boots were to be had as good \nand as cheap, there is still a great deal of work left for \nthe common-sense Irish boot-buyer to do. Every reader \nof the LEADER is a purchaser of boots, anc} we put it to \nthe intellect of each one of them that they should de­\nmand in the shops in .which they deal that they be \nenabled to sample Irish-made boots that are fighting \nin competition with foreign boots. If they find them \nright as regards quality and price, they should most un­\ndoubtedly give them the preference. If our· readers \nfind that the shops in. which they deal do not offer a \nfair opportunity to their customers to-sample and use \ntheir own judgment on the merits of Irish-made boots \nas against British and foreign boots, they ought, in fair­\nness to the industrial inte1:ests of the country, to \nspeak firmly to, and what is more, act firmly with, \nsuch shop-keepers. Irish boots are entitled ·to a fair. \nfield and no favour in the shops of Ireland th.at deal in \nboots, and our readers should see as far as they reason• \nably may do so, that they get it. The boot manufac­\nturers of Ireland have rio right to ask the public for as \nmuch as,~ brass farthing for nothing, but they are en­\ntit~~!!. to a preference from the Irish buying public on \ntheir merits. We put the case this way :-It is common \nsense that the w:hole_ country benefits by the prosperity .. \nof the boot-makmg mdustry; the common-sense public \nwho read the LEADER are not asked -to make any sacri­\nfice for the sake of the special boot-making interest, but \nthey are, as common-sense, thinking people, asked to \nsee that they do not make a sacrifice for the benefit of \nBritish and American boot manufactm·ers; they a.re \nasked _to see t~at Irish-made boots get a fair field. We \nrepudiate the idea that they are entitled to any favour \nbeyond that, other things being equal, Irish boots, as \na matt~r of common sense, should ·get the preference \nfrom Irish boot _wearers ... We say that·eyery Irish boot \nshop should be m a pos1t1on. to show its customers fair \nsamples of the products of the several Irish boot factories. • \n. • The boot factory of Mr. Michael Governey, of Oarlow, \n1s a r«:_c~nt grow~h of the Industrial Revival. Mr . \nGov~rney . (tradm~ as Corcoran and Co.) is \nan extensive mmeral . water manufacturer also \na _manufl!,ctur~r, or _brewer, of hop bitters'. We \nspe~t several mtere~tmg hours looking over both fac­\ntories. Many of his mineral water machines are the \ninve~tion of _an Irishman, almost needless to say, the \n• 1Jart1cular Inshman had to go over to Britain _with his \nI \nl",

In th~ mineral water and h_op bitter industries \nMr. Governey gives employment to no less than 60 or 70 \nhands i~ the summer months, and every one of these \nbegan as boy·s in his place. Mr. Governey .manufac­\nt~res a proportion of the corks he uses, and he builds \nhis OiWn vans--and he has 21 vans on the road. It is \nevident that he is not anxious to buy anything that \nhe Cil,n produce, a disposition that it would be well for \nthe country were it more prevalent. The business mind \n-of Ireland is now, happily, turning towards productive \nindustries, and thoug4 the material results, so far, \nmay not be great, yet they are many and considerable \nAbout two years ago, some priests and people in Carlow \nivere an.-.::ious that something new should be attempted \nin the industrial world, and there was a public meeting \n·.caJled. A bacon factory was suggested; but eventually \na boot .factory found most favour. Mr. Governey had \nan interview with Mr. T'. P. Gill and an expert was sent \n<down. There were thr!3e ways of attempting to start \nth~ .. :hoot factory. One was on the co-operative plan, \n.an9ther was by means of a public comp any, and· the \nthird was by starting it as a one-man concern. For­\ntunately, Mr .Governey was prepared to take the risk \n.all on his own shoulders, and so the site of an old ruin \nis now covered by a modern , well-equipped and compact \nfactory. The problem of production was a difficult one. \nFor the task that Mr. Michael Governey, an extensive \nmineral water manufacturer, took upon himself was to \n-start a boot factory, though he possessed no practical \n-experience in that line-and more than that, start it \nin a town in which the industry was previously un­\nknown. He first had to procure the services of some \npeople from the boot manufacturing centres of England, \n.and then the training of the native workers commenced . \nAnyone who has had any experience in the trials and \n• troubles of starting a new industry can readily apprP-­\n•ciate the difficulty of Mr . Governey 's task. Last \n'Thursday week we were over the factory. About 45 \nCarlow hands are now employed there, in addition lo \n.the few fully experienced hands whom Mr . Governey \n.brought over to teach the industry. As this is not a. \n. technical journal, any detailed reference to technical \nprocesses would be out of place. Needless to say the \nprinciple of the division of labour is largely availed of, \n·.and the employees work at various ingenious machines. \nThe girls work at a great table in· a room to them­\nselves. The appearance of the place was thoroughly \nbusiness like, and it was pleasant to watch young, newly \ntr~ined hands pushing on with their special division of \n. the now much divided operation of turning out a \n• machine-made boot. Nothing but leather is used, and \nMr. ··Governey 1s of course anxious to use as much Irish \ntanned leather as possible on business principles. Mr . \n,Governey, a keen business man as well as an Irishman \n,of public spirit, has now solved the problem of pr~­\n<lucing machine-made boots in a town where no suc11 \n. industry before existed. It is now for the common \nsense Irish public to lend a hand to help in the problem \nof disti·ibution. Mr. Governey asks no customer of \nhis to: sacrifice as much as a ha'penny in the way of \n.bolstering up Carlow-made boots. He sells as a busi­\n;ness man, and claini.s that his boots can be sold by the \n:retailer at competitive prices on the open market. \n. 'The fact that one of the great English distributing .firms \n'ithat have many branches in Ireland, are large pur­\nchasers of his boots, indicates their power to stand \nthe test of competition. Up to this, ladies and chil­\ndren's. boots have been practically the sole. out-put of \nthe, factory. Attention is now being given to men's \nlboots. For our part, though we aFe not experts, the \n·boots that we saw appeared to us as exceptional value \nat the prices at which they could be sold by retail \nfirms. The output at present is, we believe, about 500 \npairs weekly; within a reasonable time it· could be in­\n.creased to 1,500 pairs weekly, and after that-well, \nCarlow has plenty of room for extended factories, and \nMr. Michael Governey is an enterprising man . \nThere is plenty of room for a dozen, an:d many a \ndozen, more boot factories in Ireland. A new boot fac­\ntory is a benefit to existing factories. We remember \nover four years ago, when we were looking for informa­\ntion for our \".Nation Building '' article on boots, we \nheard much at Winstanley's great factory in Dublin, \nabout the inconveniences of the lack of an adequate \nIrish labour market in the boot industry. Now with \nthriving factories in Waterford, Cork, Belfast, Dublin \nand Carlow, that difficulty is being overcome; and \nwith a good supply of trained labour, the expansion of \nthe boot industry ought to· be comparatively easy in the \nfuture. • \nThere is no boot shop in Ireland that ought not to \nhave a stock of boots from one or more, if not all, the \nIrish boot factories. If a pmchaser goes into a shop \nand wishes to buy Irish boots on their merits, it is a \nshame that he is not given an opportunity to do so, and \nthe time has come when the consumers should again \nrouse themselves and do a hand's turn for Irish industry \nby talking to the shop-keepers for the shop-keepers' . \nown good. The boot manufacturers of Ireland. sell on \nmerits, and they deserve support on their merits; and \nit is very difficult for customers to give that support if \nshop after shop they go into have not a sufficient range \nof Irish-made boots in stock. \nThere is a busy go-a-head air about Carlow town that \nis in pleasant contrast to the tumble-clown appearance \nof too many other Irish towns. The \" beauty that \nhovers round decay \" is all very well in its way. The \nbeautiful and massive ruins of Carlow Castle stand in \nthe grounds of Mr. Michael Governey. But if he owns \nthe beautiful ruins of an ancient castle, he has founded \ntwo productive industries within reach of their shadows \nA HISTORY OF IRISH MUSIC.\" ' \nM \nR GRATI'AN FLOOD 'S \"History of Irish Music \" \nl has been received with a universal welcome, and I \ngiladly join m y voice in the general chorus of congratulation . \nTh e book is the work of a lifetime, the result of careful, \nprolonged, indefatig;i,ble research, and the amount of in­\nformation presented to the reader is, truly wonderful. \nBut while admitting frel'>ly the many merits of the book. \nthe critic must, as a duty, point otit some · draw-backs. \nTh ese are principally two-a want of style and a want· ·of \ncritical judgment. Under the first aspect the author can­\nnot be excused from a fair amount of carelessness. The· in­\nformation soom , sometimes to be thrown in simply in a \nheap, without any attempt at order. To give an example, \nwe get some infonnation about Ogham writing in two para­\ngraphs on pp. 2 and 3. In the next paragraph this subject \nis left, and afte,r learning something from MacFirbis' MS. \nBook of Genealogies and the Dinn Seanchils., we \"·come to \nthe close of tl1e third century, when we are on fairly solid \nhistorical ground.\" Immediately· we ai',e canied back,, in \nthe next paragraph, to the fifth century before Christ, and \nwe also learn something about the Galatians iri the time of \nSt. Jerome. Fina.Uy, a.ftar all these excursions, we come \nback to the subject of Ogham writing. I am glad to sa.y \nthat the later cha.pters of the book are more satisfactory, \nalthough here, too, information is sometimas thrown in \n\"aprop_os of \" sometl1ing.

Now, I have·no \nfears on this score in regard to men of the John Martfo \nor Mitchell or Douglas Hyde stamp, whose co-operation \nis worth having, and for whom we have never been want ­\ning in respect and gratitude. Rather-and I speak with \nlion experience of every part of the kingdom, and even \nof the home life of those differing from us in the faith­\nther.e is grave danger that in endeavouring, grati­\ntuously, to propitiate our separated brethren, we shall, \nb7 modifying our views and paring down our prin­\nciples, lose ten times more than we are likely to gain. \nToo _many of these people, I am sorry to say, either \nhate or despise us, while the bulk of the best of them­\npatronizingly self-sufficient men of the Horace Plunkett \nstamp-,-have less respect for the prejudices and suscep­\ntibilities of the Irish Papist than they would in similar \ncircumstances have for those of the Mohammedan fel­\nlah of Egypt, or the Hindu of India. \n\" DESMOND. \" \nTHE DEMON OF INTEMPERANCE. <,! \nT\nHE \"Vision of MacConglinne,\" of which the \nbook I am reviewing is a version in· modern \nIrish, by Jrather Peter O'Leary, is a unique wonder ­\ntale in Middle Irish, of which two versions are extant. \nA long and elaborate version is given in the Leabhar \nBreac, a manuscript of the fourteenth century, and a \nshorter versidn occurs in a MS. preserved in T.C.D. \nLibrary, (H, 3, 18). Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once. Catha! did ·accord­\ningly, and from these charmed viands arose the Demon \n\" .i.n C11'-'or--oe\"m\"\"n. 4n t:4i:4111 pe\"-o\"'t' U4 l...105\"'t'e -oo \n·rc11io?I.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

And with the cost of this night out a mere \n£6.00, it seems such a small amount of money to part with for a \nfeast of fun and a very. very worthy cause. \nGive your support - It will be greatly appreciatec by all Martins \nfriends and, of course, hugely appreciated by Martin himself. \n(TICKETS FOR THE EVENT ARE AVAILABLE FROM EMPRIE \nMUSIC, O'CONNELL STREET) \nPage Nine \nl \n! \nl I \n\\ \nJ \nI \n1 \n' J \nr.-\\",

This is definitely emerging , \nwith crafts people and country traders pitch­\ning their stalls every Friday and Saturday. \nTheir is top class produce - it's their liveli­\nhood - it's part of what we are, city and \ncountry. So, get down there next Friday and \nSaturday and keep it up . \nTHE UMERICK EVENTS GUIDE WISH \nTO THANK BRENDAN WOODS, GEN . \nMANAGER OF LIMERICK MARKET \nTRUSTEES FOR HIS HELP IN COMPILING \nTHIS FEATURE . \nPage Nine \nSPORT \nGuitars and goals; plectrums and \npenalties ; Landsdowne Road and \nthe Marquee Club -What have \nthey all in common ? Absolutely \nnothing .. except for 'Soccer \nRocker', of course. Yes, NIALL \nQUINN, of The Hitchers fame \nexplains why it's all Rock'n'Roll \non the footie field. \nM yself, me m ate Benny and a handful of others \nturned up at Hogan park the other wee kend to wa tch \nLim erick dem olish W aterford U nited 3-1 and all we re in agreem ent that Lim ­\nerick are loo king goo d . T hey pretty mu ch overw helm ed W aterford wi th \ngood, fast attacking football. In m y first Soccer Rocker, w ay back in Nove m ­\nber, 1 expressed w orry that Limerick we re a bit predictable in attack. Th ey \nseemed to get as far as the edge of the opposition box and then chicken out, \nchip the ball to Howie King and then hope for the best.-But these days indi­\nviduals seem to be shouldering mo re responsibility ..... H aving a go them ­\nselves rather than passing the buck as well as the ball. T he arrival of Anth ony \n\"Bubb les\"(??) Tobin in particular has made Lime rick's attack m uch m ore \nvaried and dangerou s. More peop le are getting on the score sheet and w ith \nthe pressure of being the focus of Limerick's attacks seemingly lifted -H owie \nKing is scoring his way into the Leagues leading scorers table. King got Lim ­\nerick's third against Waterford and he came very close on another couple of \noccasions, as did D aithi McMahon. D aithi and Pat Ke ane scored Lime rick's \nother two on an afternoon when Limerick did very little w rong ( ... the sun \neven cam e out .. and it was m e birthday). it was also pal Be nny's first tim e up \nat a Limerick gam e and he was quick to point out that it was an excellent \nafternoon's entertainment for a mere quid (student/unwaged ) w hich also \nincludes entry into a free draw c!nd - for drivers - there's also free parking \nspace. So there you have it ! Come along ... It's time to see mo re people up \nthere supporting the city. \northern Ireland crack me up . The y really do . Wacky, wacky guys. Last \nissue I was saying that they had a goalkeeper (R eal) back in their squad for \nthe meeting with the republic of Ireland in Dublin. Well T omm y Wright can't \nmake it so they had to go scouring the English Leagues for a 'keeper. ow \nthat shouldn't be too difficult as anyone with a British passport can declare \nfor No rthern Ireland . So who do they ask? Is it the keeper with one of the \nother also-ran prem iership sides? ( o -He doesn't play in the premierships). \nDoe s he play in the First Division then? ( ope) ot even for 1otts. C ounty? \n(H e should be so lucky). o, in fact, orthem Ireland's new ... ahem !..'goal­\nkeepe r' is C hannel Islander Trevor Wood and Trevor plays football for \n... wai t for it ... WALSALL. Yes, Wa lsall from the arsehole of Now heresville \nthat is Division 3. So, not only is No rthern Ireland 's new keeper not even \nrem otely orthern Irish - he's also ... surprise, surprise .. .SHIT E. Th e m ost \nprolific thing o n Trevors resum e is that he conceded three goals in seven \nminu tes to the admittedly brilliant Ph ilom en Masinga. By the time you read \nthis the gam e wi ll be over and done with but l do hope that the orth play \ntheir new 'keeper on W ednesday. D epend ing on them d oing so I think I've \ngo t a pretty accurate picture form ing in m y head of how events will unfold: \nRepublic of Ireland 'K eeper A lan Ke lly battles hypotherm ia by shaggin' off \nfor another flask of hot soup and an electric blanket to wra p him self in as he \nsettles dow n -in the hamm ock he's struck across his goalmouth- with a goo d \nboo k. Meanw hile, dow n the other end , o rthern lrelands new 'keeper \nTrevor Wood is stretchered off with a back injury, sustained from excessive \nbend ing down to pick the ball out of the back of his net. But staying deadly \nserious, If 'N orn Iron' were to get a goal early in the gam e (while Kelly's on \nhis journey home for blanket and soup), they could be a really awk w ard \nshower of shaggers to beat. provided Keith Gillespie is suitably shackled by \nthe m ore than able D enis Irwin, there shouldn't be too much to wo rry about. \nBut I think it's vital that our lads go for goals early and show the No rth just \nw ho's going to the European Ch amp ionships next year and just wh o's go t \nW alsall's goalkeeper in their side. \nW ell, I'm outta here.

          "raw_text": "Thursday M.uch30th-Wednesday April 12theLIMERICK EVENTS GUIDE \nALL GOOD \nL~ka Bloom, The Tindersticks, Fred­\ndi~ Johnston and They Might Be \nGiants all owe their current success to \nthe musical attributes of Limerick­\nman, TOM PRENDERGAST. \nTom, ~ho originally comes from John \nstreet, is co-owner and director of the \nacclaimed indie-label BAR/NONE \nRECORDS, based in Hoboken, \nNew Jersey, USA. The label is cur­\nrently in its eighth year of existence \nwith 20 artists signed and over 55 ' \nreleases to date. Bar/None has built its \nown pedestal and now competes \nadmirably with the major labels of \nthe music industry. \nAfter working in pirate radio and pro­\nmoting bands in Ireland, Tom trav­\nelled to Hoboken in 1982. he found \nwork in various bars, including \nMaxwell's (a favourite haunt of \nR.E.M. guitarist, Peter Buck). Having \nsaved hard he was eventually able to open his \nown record shop, Pier Platters in Hoboken , \nand due to the diversity of its range, was an \nimmediate success. \n\"I lapped into a market which wa s virtually \nuntouched at the time,\" says Tom . \nThe shop has now a reputation in the States as \none of the best alternative record shops in the \nwhole country. Tom has since expanded and \nnow owns a chain of record stores. \nDuring these early days \nTom managed a band \ncalled RAGE TO LIVE and \nit was with lead singer \nGlenn Morrow that he \ndecided to start Bar/N one. \n\"The aim of the label was \nto give talent, not just in \nHoboken but all around, a \nchance to gain recogni­\ntion,\" says Tom. Yet he still \nconfirms Hoboken's world­\nwide reputation as a mu sic ❖----\nMecca, claiming, \"There is '--------• no Seattle grunge scene here, just an amazing wealth of gifted artists of different styles and \ntastes.\" • Bar/None Records achieved instant success with the group THEY MIGHT BE GIA N T S \nwhose first album sold more than 100,000 copies, in 1987. Their second release, Liuco/u, alm ost \ndoubled the previous effort and even ruffled U2 's feathers by remo ving R nttle n11d H 11 111 from \nthe college charts' topspot. their major label debut 'Flood' went gold, spawn ing the wo rldwide \nhit Birdhouse in Your Soul. Folk-rock artist FREDDIE JOHNSTON, wh ose videos 'Tlze \nLucky One ' and 'Bad Reputation' were seen recently on Donal Dineen 's popular N o Disco pro­\ngramme, also recorded two albums with Bar/Non e, while LUKA BLOOM , brother of Christy \nMoore, also started with the label. Although these artists are now with major labels, their con ­\ntinued success will mean their back catalogue with Bar/None will sell too. \nLimerick band, A TOUCH OF OLIVER were also signed, releasing an epon ymou sly titled \ndebut album in 1993. \"I scout for bands personally,\" says Tom, \"and while I was in Limerick a few years ago, l cam e \nacross DlARMUlD O'SULLIVAN and the rest \nof the lads -I was quite impressed.\" \nAccording to Tom , the album is still selling in \nthe States, even though the band have since split \nup. However, it is greatly respected group, THE \nTINDERSTICKS, who are the current flag­\nship of Bar/None. Their self-titled debut record \nwas voted 'Album of tlze Year 1994' by M elody \nMaker',while their second album (again a dou­\nble), has already caused much excitement among \nthe British and Irish music press. \n\"We secured the US distribution rights to the \nband only after beating a number of other better \nfunded independents,\" Tom says. \nYet the Bar/None story doesn't stop here. It con­\ntinues with a band called EPIC SOUND­\nTRACKS (writing songs for IGGY POP and \nEV AN DANDO,) and with CHRIS MARS, for­\nmer member of the kick-ass punk group THE \nREPLACEMENTS currently recording an albu \nwith the label.For Bar/None is dedicated to the \ngreat song and, as far as Tom is concerned, \"It \ndoesn't ma~ _er what style it's in, as long as it \nuplifts peopie from th~ drudgery of modern \nliving.\" ,. -By Antoiii. doss·~:'·' \nPage Eleven",

The label is cur­\nrently in its eighth year of existence \nwith 20 artists signed and over 55 ' \nreleases to date. Bar/None has built its \nown pedestal and now competes \nadmirably with the major labels of \nthe music industry. \nAfter working in pirate radio and pro­\nmoting bands in Ireland, Tom trav­\nelled to Hoboken in 1982. he found \nwork in various bars, including \nMaxwell's (a favourite haunt of \nR.E.M. guitarist, Peter Buck). Having \nsaved hard he was eventually able to open his \nown record shop, Pier Platters in Hoboken , \nand due to the diversity of its range, was an \nimmediate success. \n\"I lapped into a market which wa s virtually \nuntouched at the time,\" says Tom . \nThe shop has now a reputation in the States as \none of the best alternative record shops in the \nwhole country. Tom has since expanded and \nnow owns a chain of record stores. \nDuring these early days \nTom managed a band \ncalled RAGE TO LIVE and \nit was with lead singer \nGlenn Morrow that he \ndecided to start Bar/N one. \n\"The aim of the label was \nto give talent, not just in \nHoboken but all around, a \nchance to gain recogni­\ntion,\" says Tom. Yet he still \nconfirms Hoboken's world­\nwide reputation as a mu sic ❖----\nMecca, claiming, \"There is '--------• no Seattle grunge scene here, just an amazing wealth of gifted artists of different styles and \ntastes.\" • Bar/None Records achieved instant success with the group THEY MIGHT BE GIA N T S \nwhose first album sold more than 100,000 copies, in 1987. Their second release, Liuco/u, alm ost \ndoubled the previous effort and even ruffled U2 's feathers by remo ving R nttle n11d H 11 111 from \nthe college charts' topspot. their major label debut 'Flood' went gold, spawn ing the wo rldwide \nhit Birdhouse in Your Soul. Folk-rock artist FREDDIE JOHNSTON, wh ose videos 'Tlze \nLucky One ' and 'Bad Reputation' were seen recently on Donal Dineen 's popular N o Disco pro­\ngramme, also recorded two albums with Bar/Non e, while LUKA BLOOM , brother of Christy \nMoore, also started with the label. Although these artists are now with major labels, their con ­\ntinued success will mean their back catalogue with Bar/None will sell too. \nLimerick band, A TOUCH OF OLIVER were also signed, releasing an epon ymou sly titled \ndebut album in 1993. \"I scout for bands personally,\" says Tom, \"and while I was in Limerick a few years ago, l cam e \nacross DlARMUlD O'SULLIVAN and the rest \nof the lads -I was quite impressed.\" \nAccording to Tom , the album is still selling in \nthe States, even though the band have since split \nup. However, it is greatly respected group, THE \nTINDERSTICKS, who are the current flag­\nship of Bar/None. Their self-titled debut record \nwas voted 'Album of tlze Year 1994' by M elody \nMaker',while their second album (again a dou­\nble), has already caused much excitement among \nthe British and Irish music press. \n\"We secured the US distribution rights to the \nband only after beating a number of other better \nfunded independents,\" Tom says. \nYet the Bar/None story doesn't stop here. It con­\ntinues with a band called EPIC SOUND­\nTRACKS (writing songs for IGGY POP and \nEV AN DANDO,) and with CHRIS MARS, for­\nmer member of the kick-ass punk group THE \nREPLACEMENTS currently recording an albu \nwith the label.For Bar/None is dedicated to the \ngreat song and, as far as Tom is concerned, \"It \ndoesn't ma~ _er what style it's in, as long as it \nuplifts peopie from th~ drudgery of modern \nliving.\" ,. -By Antoiii. doss·~:'·' \nPage Eleven",

Question -\n'What's the difference between Ralf Schumacher and God/' Answer -\n'God doesn't think he's Ralf Schumacher!'. As you might gather then \nyoung Schuey has gained for himself the reputation of being a tad ego­\ncentric, ever so slightly \"me, me, me\" and a smidgen self centred. No \nwonder then that his 1997 team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella fell out so \nsoon after their one and only season together.The lowest point of this \nhigh jinxed relationship came when Ralf somehow got it into his ever \nsomeone who at times suffers from the God Complex. \nAnd this leaves Eddie Jordan (team principal} with a bit of a problem. \nWe all realise that both his 1998 drivers (Young Ralf and auld Damon \nHill) are capable of making up a dashingly dynamic duo - feared by \nsome. faster than most and admired by all -with Damon supplying the \nexperience and Schumacher providing the raw speed needed to \nachieve this, but if both end up hating one another, then all we'll be left \nwith is a disgruntled, unmotivated ex-World Champion, a Deutch­\nlandic hotshoe as directionless as ever and still no victories. Looking \nenlarging skull that Giancarlo didn't merit being ahead of him in the at the evidence from last year the odds aren't exactly stacked in \n:~::n:::e:::~d:;r;~eand so naturally enough put teutonic foot to Eddie's fav:~:.-.. ~;,:o_~,,:~~ht be a swe~, \\it\\fl~er guy .... !!!! \n---===-== ,··· .. .\"·ff~(! \n- ·' On a more positive note, if all the unfortunate Fisichella off \nthe road, into the gravel \ntrap and out of the race. \nHe later defended this \nmost unsporting of \nactions by declaring, \"I \nwas travelling faster than \nFisichella at the time, so \nit was inevitable I should \nattempt to pass him'. \nWell now , the worlds media \n(and everyone else) had but two problems with this explanation. \nFirstly, as of the last time we checked, attempting to pass is not the \nsame as slamming into the side of another car, and second, the only \nreason Ralf was travelling faster at the time was because, unlike the \nprudent Italian, he had failed to reign in his speed as they approached \none of those tight corner thingies (somewhere where full throttle \nalways equals straight on, not go round, tyre barrier, smashed, bent, \nbroken, car, etc, etc ...... ). \nNot very clever and not very nice. Not very clever for the simple rea­\nson that had this little coming together not occurred it looked likely \nthat both Jordan's were going to occupy the top two slots by the time \nthe chequered flag was unfurled, and not very nice because it really \npissed off Fisichella - being the leading Jordan driver at the time he \nwould have inherited the aforementioned win (Ralf went on to take \nthird). Conclusion? Ralf Schumacher exhibits all the characteristics of \n' pieces do slot together, and the \ndrivers remain good working part­\nners, then we're sure to see all the \npotential of Jordan's 1997 season \nflower into something less frus­\ntrating than a medley of missed \nopportunities, crashed cars, blown \ntyres, mind boggling mistakes and \ncareer crushing mechanical failures \n- how about several legitimate poles \nand wins maybe . So now, as we all prepare to knuckle down for anoth­\ner 17 rounds of the championship lets sit back, break out a couple of \nbeers and take solace from the fact that both Damon and Ralf have \npublicly stated their desire to co-operate, get along and hopefully to \nrid the team of their perennial wannabe status. \nIts funny though, when Ralf said recently that Damon would give a \ngreat deal of technical input to the team and that he (Schumacher) \nwas sure to benefit from this - as they \"worked well together\" - I \ncouldn't help thinking back to Argentina and Ralf's habit of saying \nthings that when examined closely were in exact opposition to reali­\nty. Lets just hope then that, as with all bad habits, he has learned to rid \nhimself of this particularly unwholesome trait, and that he will become \nrenowned for getting across the line first and not simply for being \nfuzzy with his logic when getting people cross!",

He is totally befit­\nting the many descriptions of the \nband's laid back \"of the people\" atti­\ntude. It was said of them that \"you'll \nlisten in vain for the usual rock cliches \nabout a life on the road, drug prob­\nlems and easy sex\" this is not their \nstyle - instead they sing about the \nordinary things in life but not in a \ncountry and western kind of a way. \nSo what have the Saw Doctors \nbeen up to since .... well since whenev­\ner we last heard of them whenever \nthat was. The last single released in \nIreland was at the end of 1996 - yes \nnearly a year and half ago. Pearse \nexplains \"well after that we took some \ntime off - six months off just to go \naway from it all and come back fresh. \nJan, a friend asked us to Sunstreet stu­\ndios to write songs with Padraig \nStevens who started writing with \nDavy (Carton) and Leo (Moran). They \nrecorded as they went along and dur­\ning February and April last year 20 \nsongs were recorded\". \ndrop18 \nWith material for a new album under \ntheir belt the Sawdoccors then decid­\ned co make a concerted effort at the \nimmense American audience, doing 28 \ndaces in a very shore time frame. The \nefforts were rewarded when a small \nNew York based record company, \nParadigm records signed them. Until \nthen the Sawdoccors records were \nonly available through import in \nAmerica which meant that they cost \ntwice the normal price. They used \ntheir own record label \"Shamtown \nRecords\" until then but as P~arse put \nit \"We couldn't bring our label to the \nstates and we needed a record com­\npany on the ground\" Paradigm are \njust chat although they wouldn't be \nthe biggest record company in the \nworld or even the state and this is \ntheir first ever signing of a band from \noutside the states. \nA U.S. album was quickly cut which \ncomprised of a \"best of .. \" the initial \nthree albums from the Sawdoctors. It \nwas released last November and sold \nover 20,000 copies which isn't bad \ngoing. According to Pearse \"our pro­\nfile is increasing in the states in our \nlast tour alone we played to over \n1 \nl",

This was \ndue in no small way to the North managing to burgle a one-nil win \nbut also due to their frankly baffling appointment of the ancient and \nbewildering Lawrie Mc Menemy as their new manager which was \nannounced the day before the game . The ugly scenes outside Tolka \nPark distracted from the game too when it became apparent that the \nFAI had seriously underestimated the interest in this game on both \nsides of the border. The result being that well over a thousand people \nwho had bought tickets in advance were locked out while their seats \nwere occupied by people who had received complimentaries from the \nFAI (at this point is anyone elses mind awash with phrases like \"pis­\nsup\", \"brewery\" and \"couldn't organise a ... \"?). The game itself held a \ncouple of nuggets of information and revelations though, the first \nbeing, ... and I'm sorry ye've to hear this from me, ... IRELAND WON'T \nBE WINNING the World Cup , European championship or anything \nelse any.time soon. \nBeyond that we've learned that Damien Duff is indeed a fine foot­\nballer and that while St. Johnstone & Northern Ireland's George O' \nboyle knows where the back of the net is - no such thing can be said \nwith any certainty of Barnet and Republic of Ireland striker Sean \nDevine, so as the coach carrying the glorious sons of Ulster roared \naway to the North, with the breeze enveloping their glad hearted ren­\ndition of \"Who put the ball in the back of the Fenian bastards \nnet .... George did, George did\", we were left wondering who will pro-\nvide an alternative to the ageing Niall Quinn, the pacey but lightweight \nDavid Conolly or the seemingly always injured Keith O' Neil// At least \non this showing it won 't be Sean Devine anyway. \nReturning to the northern Ireland/Lawrie McMenemy thing a \nminute ...... what are the IFA thinking? They fired the tactically limited \nBryan Hamilton despite his excellent coaching, developmental and \norganising skills (amongst other things, the north have now have an \nU-18 side for the first time instigated by Hamilton) and replaced him \nwith McMenemy - ten years Hamilton's senior, every bit as tactically \nchallenged, hasn't a clue about coaching, cares less and introduces \nhimself as a prospective northern \"big jack\". I hope it stays fine for \nhim.",

Question -\n'What's the difference between Ralf Schumacher and God/' Answer -\n'God doesn't think he's Ralf Schumacher!'. As you might gather then \nyoung Schuey has gained for himself the reputation of being a tad ego­\ncentric, ever so slightly \"me, me, me\" and a smidgen self centred. No \nwonder then that his 1997 team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella fell out so \nsoon after their one and only season together.The lowest point of this \nhigh jinxed relationship came when Ralf somehow got it into his ever \nsomeone who at times suffers from the God Complex. \nAnd this leaves Eddie Jordan (team principal} with a bit of a problem. \nWe all realise that both his 1998 drivers (Young Ralf and auld Damon \nHill) are capable of making up a dashingly dynamic duo - feared by \nsome. faster than most and admired by all -with Damon supplying the \nexperience and Schumacher providing the raw speed needed to \nachieve this, but if both end up hating one another, then all we'll be left \nwith is a disgruntled, unmotivated ex-World Champion, a Deutch­\nlandic hotshoe as directionless as ever and still no victories. Looking \nenlarging skull that Giancarlo didn't merit being ahead of him in the at the evidence from last year the odds aren't exactly stacked in \n:~::n:::e:::~d:;r;~eand so naturally enough put teutonic foot to Eddie's fav:~:.-.. ~;,:o_~,,:~~ht be a swe~, \\it\\fl~er guy .... !!!! \n---===-== ,··· .. .\"·ff~(! \n- ·' On a more positive note, if all the unfortunate Fisichella off \nthe road, into the gravel \ntrap and out of the race. \nHe later defended this \nmost unsporting of \nactions by declaring, \"I \nwas travelling faster than \nFisichella at the time, so \nit was inevitable I should \nattempt to pass him'. \nWell now , the worlds media \n(and everyone else) had but two problems with this explanation. \nFirstly, as of the last time we checked, attempting to pass is not the \nsame as slamming into the side of another car, and second, the only \nreason Ralf was travelling faster at the time was because, unlike the \nprudent Italian, he had failed to reign in his speed as they approached \none of those tight corner thingies (somewhere where full throttle \nalways equals straight on, not go round, tyre barrier, smashed, bent, \nbroken, car, etc, etc ...... ). \nNot very clever and not very nice. Not very clever for the simple rea­\nson that had this little coming together not occurred it looked likely \nthat both Jordan's were going to occupy the top two slots by the time \nthe chequered flag was unfurled, and not very nice because it really \npissed off Fisichella - being the leading Jordan driver at the time he \nwould have inherited the aforementioned win (Ralf went on to take \nthird). Conclusion? Ralf Schumacher exhibits all the characteristics of \n' pieces do slot together, and the \ndrivers remain good working part­\nners, then we're sure to see all the \npotential of Jordan's 1997 season \nflower into something less frus­\ntrating than a medley of missed \nopportunities, crashed cars, blown \ntyres, mind boggling mistakes and \ncareer crushing mechanical failures \n- how about several legitimate poles \nand wins maybe . So now, as we all prepare to knuckle down for anoth­\ner 17 rounds of the championship lets sit back, break out a couple of \nbeers and take solace from the fact that both Damon and Ralf have \npublicly stated their desire to co-operate, get along and hopefully to \nrid the team of their perennial wannabe status. \nIts funny though, when Ralf said recently that Damon would give a \ngreat deal of technical input to the team and that he (Schumacher) \nwas sure to benefit from this - as they \"worked well together\" - I \ncouldn't help thinking back to Argentina and Ralf's habit of saying \nthings that when examined closely were in exact opposition to reali­\nty. Lets just hope then that, as with all bad habits, he has learned to rid \nhimself of this particularly unwholesome trait, and that he will become \nrenowned for getting across the line first and not simply for being \nfuzzy with his logic when getting people cross!",

We were lucky the pub we had stumbled \ninto was hosting a Quadraphonic night with Razor one of their resi­\ndents. He served up a jazzy blend of drum n bass and even dropped \nin a few soul tracks and even if the crowd were more into chugging \nback a few cans of cider and listening to Bon Jovi, it w as nice to hear \nthe jazzy blend drifting threw the smoke filled bar. \nWe walked the short distance around the corner to the GPO , for one \nof the highlights of the Weekende r, Mr. Cook a.k.a. Fatboy Slim. The \nvenue was already half full and Johnny Moy , the Influx supremo was \ngrinding together a delicious blend of breakbeats and funky hip-hop, \nthen the unima?inable happened - the music stopped, the houselights \nca~e on and 11 Se~ tplijthat hot food was being served, yum yum . \nThis was thanks to t~ e ·Galway Gardai, who believed that food served \nin the nightclubs would deter people from going to fast food restau­\nrant after the clubs and starting fights, this must be with out doubt the \nmost ridiculous idea ever thought up in the history of mankind. I \nalways believed that some chicken curry served during a club, while \nthe music was stopped would bring a halt to trouble on the streets of \nIreland. \nThen exactly at 12.15 am Fatboy Slim took to the decks and began the \nparty, and he was in the mood for a party. Starting off with some jump \non the table hip-hop, he started to get his audience in the mood .After \nabout twenty minutes he drops in Cornershop, his own mix of \n'Brimful Of Asha' and this drifts straight into Renegade Master \n'Wildchild', the crowd react as if they have been told that work has \nbeen called off on Monday and that they will still get paid. Things begin \nto heat up and the bassline is starting to rip the plaster of the walls, \nthe sound of summer is upon us, the crowd are ecstatic more plea­\nsures are in the post. Dr. Bone 'Came to get ripped' starts the crowd \ninto samba dancing and at this stage the venue is at boiling point and \nis danger of being leveled to the ground, but there is no holding back \nand nobody is complaining. Next its a slice of demon jungle and cheer \ngoes up and up and up, hey !!! where has the roof gone no matter \nkeep dancing. He then drops Freddy Fresh 'Drum Lesson', a swinging \nsurf tune with a devilish beat and then the volcano erupts and still the \nparty continues, they seem to be dancing everywhere on chairs, tables, \ncounters and on shoulders. Even by the table the mod boys are beat­\ning the counter to the sound of the drum, their life has been spiced \nup. The music then at two o'clock grinds to a halt and heads turn and \nstare at amazement it can't be over. So Norman gives us one more \none that really maybe has no place but is a fitting end The Verve's \n'Bitter sweet symphony'. The houselights are turned on and the \nbouncer's begin their familiar bark. We grab our coats and fall outside \nwhere the wind and rain are driving everyone home. All that can be \nsaid is please, please it all was a better living for CHEMISTRY. \ndrop20 \nfatboyslim \nThe World Cup is only four months away and everyone is scrambling \nfor the position and honour to record their countries football \nanthem, Pulp, Boo Radleys and Damon Albarn are all in the running, \nbut it looks as if Echo And The Bunnymen have emerged as the book­\nies favorites. Meanwhile Teenage Fanclub are in contention to provide \nScotland's song for the World Cup campaign, with the dire Wet Wet \nWet and Del Amitri among other candidates. \nThe Verve are to release 'Sonnet' as a single, but on 12-inch vinyl only, \nit will be sold in a customized Verve cardboard envelope.They will also \nrelease the last three singles on vinyl for the first time. The return of \nthe 7-inch. \nGarbage are just putting the final touches to their second album, \n'Versions 2.0'. The first single is to be 'Push lt'-and no its not a \nSalt'n'Pepa cover. The album will contain a cover of Big Star's \n\"Thirteen\". There's also a song with the working title of \"Special\", \nwhich has been described as a tribute to Chrissie Hynde lead singer \nwith the Pretenders. \nWilliam Reid, of the Jesus And Mary Chain, is releasing his first ever \nsolo single, titled 'Tired Of pl=l=l<ing'.The Mary Chain, who have just re­\nsigned to Creation, will be back later this year with a new album. \nMicheal Hutchence committed suicide, according to the coroner and \nhe didn't die from an act of auto-eroticism, well isn't that a story. \nA friend of mine has brought to my attention that Cornershop's \n'Brimful Of Asha' is a rip off of Lou Reeds 'Sweet Jane', well its not a \nnew idea stealing a riff from someone else's song for your 45. \nA new charity album, intitled 'Gimmie Shelter' is released on March 9. \nThe CD boasts of an excellent line-up, Everything But The Girl, \nProdigy, Snuff, Reef, Cast, Audioweb, 808 State, Bis, 3 Colours Red , \nJamiroquai, Dubstar and the delightful Mark Owen . Irish band Ash, \nappear on the album with a live version of 'Let It Flow' recorded at \nthe Astoria in London. Talking of Irish bands, Limericks own pop dar­\nlings, The Hitchers have been nominated in the Hotpress awards, \nwhich will be held in Belfast in a few weeks. \nOcean Colour Scene release 'It's A Beautiful Thing', which still gives no \nevidence to suggest that they don't deserve to go down in history as \none of the most boring bands to have sold an obscene amount of \nrecords. Drum n bass maestro LTJ Bukem releases more easy listen­\ning tunes 'Mystical Realms' and finally French duo Daft Punk kick back \nwith 'Revolution 909' another roaring, blinding dance floor filler. \nA new regular feature starting this week titled CLASSIC \nBUYS will advise the reader to part with their money and buy \nthe CD's we talk about.

It's got \na pronounced natural acoustic feel and does \nindeed have jazz elements. It has technical intri­\ncate yet lightweight composition. I shyly enquired \nwhether they would identify the Cardigans w ith \nthemselves, fully expecting a torrent of artistic \nindignation. Imelda, however wasn't offended; \"I \nguess we would be easy listening\". \nShane agreed that the group has a retro feel to it \nbut put it in context -\"We go back to Bette \nMidler and further back to thirties Jazz\" He \nstrummed a chord and elaborated \"That's E -\nWhether you're playing Country and Western , \nJazz or heavy metal; its always E.

Shane cited Bob \nMarley and the Pixies as artists he admired \nbecause \"they turned mus ic on its head\" \nWhen the band ·started in late 1995, he \nwent through a period of not listening to \nthe radio as \" a groove had to be found \nbefore we could continue\" He explained \nand played a few bars. \n\"On it's own that's just a jingly - jangly gui­\ntar\" \nHe nodded towards Ronan and played the \nsame intro this time with bass and vocals \" \nI couldn't survive without the band and \nthey couldn't survive without me\" \nThe interview officially ended here, but as I \ncollected my equipment and began to deci­\npher my substandard shorthand, Shane said \n\"C'mon we'll play you some tunes\" and \nthey did. \nwith 'Smokers Delights' released in the summer of 95. A wicked working of okey dokey beats. \nThis album was true to its title an album for the herbalist, it contains the classic tunes 'Mission \nVenice' an up-beat journey threw the valleys of Narnia, 'Stars' which takes on the hip-hop feel \nand drifts in and out between the floating clouds which cover the concrete urban jungle and the \nopening delight of'Night lntrolude' with a sample of'Summer In The City' by Quincy Jones, a gem \nto grace the beginning of any journey in to the delights which smokers delight holds for you.

Question -\n'What's the difference between Ralf Schumacher and God/' Answer -\n'God doesn't think he's Ralf Schumacher!'. As you might gather then \nyoung Schuey has gained for himself the reputation of being a tad ego­\ncentric, ever so slightly \"me, me, me\" and a smidgen self centred. No \nwonder then that his 1997 team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella fell out so \nsoon after their one and only season together.The lowest point of this \nhigh jinxed relationship came when Ralf somehow got it into his ever \nsomeone who at times suffers from the God Complex. \nAnd this leaves Eddie Jordan (team principal} with a bit of a problem. \nWe all realise that both his 1998 drivers (Young Ralf and auld Damon \nHill) are capable of making up a dashingly dynamic duo - feared by \nsome. faster than most and admired by all -with Damon supplying the \nexperience and Schumacher providing the raw speed needed to \nachieve this, but if both end up hating one another, then all we'll be left \nwith is a disgruntled, unmotivated ex-World Champion, a Deutch­\nlandic hotshoe as directionless as ever and still no victories. Looking \nenlarging skull that Giancarlo didn't merit being ahead of him in the at the evidence from last year the odds aren't exactly stacked in \n:~::n:::e:::~d:;r;~eand so naturally enough put teutonic foot to Eddie's fav:~:.-.. ~;,:o_~,,:~~ht be a swe~, \\it\\fl~er guy .... !!!! \n---===-== ,··· .. .\"·ff~(! \n- ·' On a more positive note, if all the unfortunate Fisichella off \nthe road, into the gravel \ntrap and out of the race. \nHe later defended this \nmost unsporting of \nactions by declaring, \"I \nwas travelling faster than \nFisichella at the time, so \nit was inevitable I should \nattempt to pass him'. \nWell now , the worlds media \n(and everyone else) had but two problems with this explanation. \nFirstly, as of the last time we checked, attempting to pass is not the \nsame as slamming into the side of another car, and second, the only \nreason Ralf was travelling faster at the time was because, unlike the \nprudent Italian, he had failed to reign in his speed as they approached \none of those tight corner thingies (somewhere where full throttle \nalways equals straight on, not go round, tyre barrier, smashed, bent, \nbroken, car, etc, etc ...... ). \nNot very clever and not very nice. Not very clever for the simple rea­\nson that had this little coming together not occurred it looked likely \nthat both Jordan's were going to occupy the top two slots by the time \nthe chequered flag was unfurled, and not very nice because it really \npissed off Fisichella - being the leading Jordan driver at the time he \nwould have inherited the aforementioned win (Ralf went on to take \nthird). Conclusion? Ralf Schumacher exhibits all the characteristics of \n' pieces do slot together, and the \ndrivers remain good working part­\nners, then we're sure to see all the \npotential of Jordan's 1997 season \nflower into something less frus­\ntrating than a medley of missed \nopportunities, crashed cars, blown \ntyres, mind boggling mistakes and \ncareer crushing mechanical failures \n- how about several legitimate poles \nand wins maybe . So now, as we all prepare to knuckle down for anoth­\ner 17 rounds of the championship lets sit back, break out a couple of \nbeers and take solace from the fact that both Damon and Ralf have \npublicly stated their desire to co-operate, get along and hopefully to \nrid the team of their perennial wannabe status. \nIts funny though, when Ralf said recently that Damon would give a \ngreat deal of technical input to the team and that he (Schumacher) \nwas sure to benefit from this - as they \"worked well together\" - I \ncouldn't help thinking back to Argentina and Ralf's habit of saying \nthings that when examined closely were in exact opposition to reali­\nty. Lets just hope then that, as with all bad habits, he has learned to rid \nhimself of this particularly unwholesome trait, and that he will become \nrenowned for getting across the line first and not simply for being \nfuzzy with his logic when getting people cross!",

HERE'S HOSS CARNEY 's TAKE ON HOW THINGS \nMIGHT PAN OUT. .... \nWay back in the middle of 1994 Adrian Newey - then Design \nsupremo at Williams Grand Prix -stepped out of his favourite \ndrawing office with a big cheesy grin plastered all over his \nbeaming British face. He 'd just signed off the final blueprints \nfor William's 1995 challenger the FW 15, and he knew they \namounted to a standard of conceptual excellence most others \nwould find impossible to match.All his drivers, Damon Hill \nand David Coulthard, had to do was to show up at each of \nI 995's seventeen races, ease the beast gently around the vari­\nous tracks and both titles (Drivers and Constructors) would \nmore than likely be theirs. Michael Schumacher had other \nplans though. In a car which technically had no place doing so \n(the Bennetton 195) he managed to capture both crowns for \nhimself and his extremely appreciative team.As you may imag­\nine.Adrian found all this as amusing as having a rear wing end­\nplate forcibly rammed up a very delicate part of his anatomy. \nThat was 1995. \nIn 1998, in as much as one can gather from winter testing and \nthe first race in Melbourne, it would appear that once again a \ncar penned by Adrian Newey is showing itself to be the class \nof the field, and the only other person presenting any sort of \nserious challenge is Michael Schumacher. This time around \nthough Adrian and Coulthard are ensconced at McLaren and \nSchuey works for the Prancing Horse (Ferrari), along with \nboth Pat Symonds and Rory Byrne who were chief designers \nat Bennetton the last time he lifted the Drivers Championship. \nIt just goes to show that where-ever the top people are the \nlights do tend to shine that bit brighter. With one major \nexception though. Damon Hill jumped \nship a while back and is now steadily rowing backwards for \nthe ever slowing Jordan team.A great driver maybe, but its \nhard to see even this ex-world champion taking the recalci­\ntrant 198 and making it anything other than a strongish also­\nran. Which again is reminiscent of 1995, because back then \nJordan occupied a place in the field which was widely regarded \nas the leading pack chaser. \nBeing a fairly bright person (so Mammy says anyhow!) and \nhaving thought all this through I've come to the disturbing \nconclusion that the 1998 Formula season is in fact the most \ncunningly conceived sporting deceit since Maradonna threw \nthe ball in the back of the English net!!! Forget the World \nWrestling Federation and their less than wholesome antics, \nBernie Ecclestone (FI 's chief) has come up with the scam to \nbeat all scams. Having found that the whole chore of scooting \naround the world to organise 17 races each year was begin-\nning to become a bit of a drag on himself and his beloved \nteams he's gone and hired some techno whizz-kid to air brush \nhis old Beta copies of the 1995 Championship to make them \nlook like I 998's. So when we thought we were seeing \nFerrari's Michael Schumacher pull off onto the grass in \nAustralia we were in fact witnessing a much younger (and \nbluer) Shuey climbing out of his 1995 Bennetton Renault \nsomewhere north of London. The teams get to stay at home \nand do all that spending of Fortunes stuff, the sponsors \n(Benson and Hedges, Marlboro, Parmalat, etc .... ) still get their \nblanket media coverage and we punters are left w ith a race \ncalendar as authentic as the Spice Girls are exponents of High \nArt. \nOkay so its probably way off the mark, but in one sense a big \npart of me wishes it to be true. For if it were then we might \nescape the inevitable bore of watching McLaren win every sin­\ngle race, just as they so very nearly did ten years back when \nAyrton Senna was at the wheel. And even then they would \nhave bagged the lot but for an unfortunate incident involving a \nlarge sand trap and a very broken engine. Boring! Utterly \nBoring!! While its good to see Mclaren back on song, when \nthat tune is more than 2 seconds ahead of even their closest \nrival it doesn't bode well for the entertainment factor of the \nremaining season. No one enjoys sitting down to watch a \nsporting event if the result is almost entirely predictable, not \neven if their own hero/team is the one doing all the winning. \nThat's why when David Coulthard casually aired his hope that \nMika Hakkinen (the other Mclaren driver) would allow him \nto win the next race .... not attempt to, but actually to win .... I \nlet out a long slow moan, put my head in my hands and began \nto curse Adrian Newey for doing what he does best, design \ncars no one else can compete with. Only this time they are so \nfar ahead of everyone else that they effectively negate the \npresence of all the other teams. Boring! Stupid-mongously, \novertoppedly screwballed boring! Hopefully my pessimism will \nbe countered by an upturn in the fortune of all the other \nteams, a series races which are marvellously entertaining and \npossibly a a couple of drives down blind alleys for Hakkinen \nand Coulthard. Somehow though I can't see Adrian's new \nemployer doing a '95 on it.At least we still have CART on \nEurosport .....",

In doing so they only serve to perpetuate our low \n•. I ~; ~-\n·,,..,,_;). \n~<'(J~l:>-\nexpectations and are ultimately letting the ref and co. off the \nhook. I mean think of it in reverse, when a defender completes \nan effective clearance does the linesman erupt in praise of him?!! \nof course not because that's what rightly expected of a defender, \nwe demand no less, its his job and if he doesn't do his job he'll \nloose his job to some other player the boss reckons will do it \nproperly. Does the axe fall on the referee (there's a happy \nthought) with anything like such swiftness? not on your life, why? \nbecause even at the highest level of our glorious game a player \ncan have a bad day and be penalised with a loan spell at Grimsby \ntown (with a view to a permanent move) and the slashed wages \netc. that go with it. An \"Amateur\" referee, who's doing it for the \nlove of the beautiful game, can have a dreadful game, pick up \nhis .. ahem. \"reasonable\" expenses cheque (in the premiership that \ncan be up to £1,500 a game - think about that every Saturday and \nsometimes a midweek game too) and the following morning he'll \n3 1 9 6 5 5 \nbe picking up geography homework from a class full of 13 year \nolds (while, quite possibly, some of the players he refereed are \npicking up the pieces of their careers) at worst the referee may \nget a rap on the knuckles from the FA and be informed that he \nwill not be invited to officiate in Cyprus and Estonia's world cup \nqualifier. So you will not be surprised to hear that those most \nopposed to the idea of a professional referees are ... the referees. \nWhy bring nasty little elements like tax on earnings and real \naccountability into a cushy number eh? \nPurely in football terms I can see from a referees point of view. \nThey're only human they can make mistakes like the rest of us, \nthat's why I'd like to see baseball style \"under review\" big screen \nvideo playbacks to give the referee an extra set of eyes. Also I'd \nlike to see tennis style tagging of the goal line which would pre­\nvent ridiculous situations like that which occurred in Euro 96 \nwhen Romania had a goal disallowed despite the ball having \ngone over 12-18 inches over the line. Romania were eliminated \nbecause the ref failed to see their perfectly legitimate goal. \nAnother area in which I could sympathise with refs is restrictive \nrule changes by FIFA, which remove a ref's discretion. Then \nthere are rule changes that aren't specific enough, e.g. a goal­\nkeeper must now kick out the ball \"after between five and six \nseconds\" - what the hell does that mean? Is it five or six?. It is \nmainly the restrictive rules that threatens the spirit of the game. \nUnder a new FIFA directive starting with this summer's World \nCup, refs have to send off any player who tackles from behind. \nSo why are they tinkering with the rules like this? Why remove \nthe option for a ref to caution a player who makes a silly but \nspiteless tackle in the opening minutes of a game? Just wait and \nsee teams are going to finish ninety minutes of football with \nseven or eight men on the field. FIFA hopes soon to outlaw the \nconventional tackle once and for all. FIFA says that this is to \nproject big stars like Ronaldo,Juninho, Shearer and Howie King, \nbut FIFA's real reasons can be summed up in one word -\nAmerica. The largest, richest market in the world still isn't \nwatching the game, despite giving them their own World Cup in \n94 and why? because there ain't enough goals being scored. So \nFIFA's solution is to stop defenders from doing their job and the \ngoals will follow. I love football I love watching it though I'm \nabsolutely hopeless at playing it. One of the things I love about \nfootball is one its most defining nuances; the rarity of goals. \nSome of the best games I've ever seen have been scoreless \ndraws, one-one draws or one-nil wins. One of the reasons I've \nnever bothered with Rugby or GM is the sheer value of indi­\nvidual scores. I think many football fans feel the same way I do. \nThat's why I worry if they change one of the defining nuances of \nthe great game that they'll destroy that which makes the game \ngreat in the first place. In conclusion I'm not against change - it's \nthe type of change and the direction football's going in that I \nwish as different. I think I've made it clear here that I'd like to \nsee professional referees and linesmen, as well as video playbacks \nin the professional leagues. What I don't want to see is FIFA let­\nting super rich clubs and the requirements of U.S. TV networks \nsetting the agenda for change, that's all.",

HERE'S HOSS CARNEY 's TAKE ON HOW THINGS \nMIGHT PAN OUT. .... \nWay back in the middle of 1994 Adrian Newey - then Design \nsupremo at Williams Grand Prix -stepped out of his favourite \ndrawing office with a big cheesy grin plastered all over his \nbeaming British face. He 'd just signed off the final blueprints \nfor William's 1995 challenger the FW 15, and he knew they \namounted to a standard of conceptual excellence most others \nwould find impossible to match.All his drivers, Damon Hill \nand David Coulthard, had to do was to show up at each of \nI 995's seventeen races, ease the beast gently around the vari­\nous tracks and both titles (Drivers and Constructors) would \nmore than likely be theirs. Michael Schumacher had other \nplans though. In a car which technically had no place doing so \n(the Bennetton 195) he managed to capture both crowns for \nhimself and his extremely appreciative team.As you may imag­\nine.Adrian found all this as amusing as having a rear wing end­\nplate forcibly rammed up a very delicate part of his anatomy. \nThat was 1995. \nIn 1998, in as much as one can gather from winter testing and \nthe first race in Melbourne, it would appear that once again a \ncar penned by Adrian Newey is showing itself to be the class \nof the field, and the only other person presenting any sort of \nserious challenge is Michael Schumacher. This time around \nthough Adrian and Coulthard are ensconced at McLaren and \nSchuey works for the Prancing Horse (Ferrari), along with \nboth Pat Symonds and Rory Byrne who were chief designers \nat Bennetton the last time he lifted the Drivers Championship. \nIt just goes to show that where-ever the top people are the \nlights do tend to shine that bit brighter. With one major \nexception though. Damon Hill jumped \nship a while back and is now steadily rowing backwards for \nthe ever slowing Jordan team.A great driver maybe, but its \nhard to see even this ex-world champion taking the recalci­\ntrant 198 and making it anything other than a strongish also­\nran. Which again is reminiscent of 1995, because back then \nJordan occupied a place in the field which was widely regarded \nas the leading pack chaser. \nBeing a fairly bright person (so Mammy says anyhow!) and \nhaving thought all this through I've come to the disturbing \nconclusion that the 1998 Formula season is in fact the most \ncunningly conceived sporting deceit since Maradonna threw \nthe ball in the back of the English net!!! Forget the World \nWrestling Federation and their less than wholesome antics, \nBernie Ecclestone (FI 's chief) has come up with the scam to \nbeat all scams. Having found that the whole chore of scooting \naround the world to organise 17 races each year was begin-\nning to become a bit of a drag on himself and his beloved \nteams he's gone and hired some techno whizz-kid to air brush \nhis old Beta copies of the 1995 Championship to make them \nlook like I 998's. So when we thought we were seeing \nFerrari's Michael Schumacher pull off onto the grass in \nAustralia we were in fact witnessing a much younger (and \nbluer) Shuey climbing out of his 1995 Bennetton Renault \nsomewhere north of London. The teams get to stay at home \nand do all that spending of Fortunes stuff, the sponsors \n(Benson and Hedges, Marlboro, Parmalat, etc .... ) still get their \nblanket media coverage and we punters are left w ith a race \ncalendar as authentic as the Spice Girls are exponents of High \nArt. \nOkay so its probably way off the mark, but in one sense a big \npart of me wishes it to be true. For if it were then we might \nescape the inevitable bore of watching McLaren win every sin­\ngle race, just as they so very nearly did ten years back when \nAyrton Senna was at the wheel. And even then they would \nhave bagged the lot but for an unfortunate incident involving a \nlarge sand trap and a very broken engine. Boring! Utterly \nBoring!! While its good to see Mclaren back on song, when \nthat tune is more than 2 seconds ahead of even their closest \nrival it doesn't bode well for the entertainment factor of the \nremaining season. No one enjoys sitting down to watch a \nsporting event if the result is almost entirely predictable, not \neven if their own hero/team is the one doing all the winning. \nThat's why when David Coulthard casually aired his hope that \nMika Hakkinen (the other Mclaren driver) would allow him \nto win the next race .... not attempt to, but actually to win .... I \nlet out a long slow moan, put my head in my hands and began \nto curse Adrian Newey for doing what he does best, design \ncars no one else can compete with. Only this time they are so \nfar ahead of everyone else that they effectively negate the \npresence of all the other teams. Boring! Stupid-mongously, \novertoppedly screwballed boring! Hopefully my pessimism will \nbe countered by an upturn in the fortune of all the other \nteams, a series races which are marvellously entertaining and \npossibly a a couple of drives down blind alleys for Hakkinen \nand Coulthard. Somehow though I can't see Adrian's new \nemployer doing a '95 on it.At least we still have CART on \nEurosport .....",

          "text": "SONY SCOUT \nPROFILE \nDROP spoke to the arguably the most important \nrecord scout in Ireland today, Hugh Murray of Sony \nRecords. In the job roughly two years now Hugh \nMurray has still not signed a band -an indication of \njust how tough it is to get a record deal. During his \ntime there, Hugh Murray ha$ brought two bands to \nthe Sony stables management, one wasn't accepted \nand one was made an offer they subsequently \nrefused, bearing this in mind and also that bands \ncan be dropped while there (e.g. Whipping Boy) \none can see just how narrow the path to success \nvia the main record companies can be. Hugh \nMurray explained what he's looking for, where he's \ncoming from and how he recruits. \nToday in Ireland new bands are being formed every \nminute. Due to much publicised success stories of \nIrish bands making it big, most of today's bands \nintend to follow in their footsteps. Today's bands \nhave visions of Wembley stadium, platinum record \nsales, constant media attention and all the other \nextras included in the whole fame and success deal. \nHowever to most bands the only real chance of get­\nting there, depends largely on a select number of \npeople in the business namely the A and R men, \nAKA the Record Scouts. \nHugh Murray is a former Trinity College student who \ndescribes his degree in Economics and Philosophy \nas part-time to his other pursuits which included \norganising the Trinity Ball and being events manager \nfor the Students' Union among other things. He \nlater worked as a promoter for the Mean Fiddler \nGroup before being brought to Sony. On the ques­\ntion of how bands can get his attention he explained \n\" people think I have bands ringing me up everyday \n-that's one of the myths of the job, I only get \nbetween 5 and 1 O demos a week \". \nSo how does he find out about bands and who to \nlisten to \" well I'm always travelling and listening to \nbands, this week I will be in Limerick on Monday, \nDublin on Tuesday, Limerick on Wednesday and \nDerry on Friday, I talk to people in every county \nabout bands worth looking at and mainly hear \ndrop20 \nabout them through people in the Radio stations\" \nSo what do you look for in a band? \" well there are \na number of headings that I judge a band under; \nmusic capabilities, song writing, their management, \nmusicianship and their attitude is very important.\" \nSo why haven't you signed a band in 2 years? \"I \nbrought in two acts and one was offered a deal but \nthey went somewhere else, last year was a poor \nyear for up and coming bands but this year is bet­\nter, bands like Pelvis, the Hormones, Juniper, Snow \nPatrol and the Marbles will really start selling this \nyear.\" \nWhen asked about bands who produce their own \nrecords independently, Murray gave a definite seal \nof approval saying that any band that goes through \nthe whole process of producing and promoting their \nown CD will have a better understanding of the \nwhole business and a more mature approach \"defi­\nnitely releasing independently is a good move I \ncan keep an eye on those bands for instance \nFigment and the Hitchers in Limerick\" \nIf you are involved in a band and would like to get a \nscout to listen to your music or even visit then why \nnot contact them directly. For Sony Music just ring \n01 -4051900 to get a message to Hugh Murray or \nsend up a demo to Hugh Murray, A& R Scout, \nSony Music, Carriglea, Naas Road, Dublin 12. \nDon't ~end minidisks anything else is fine, give as \nmuch information on the band as possible and give \na contact number and address.",

From the first gig, Brian \ntold me, they always played some \noriginal material. \"We write together \nand I do the lyrics. Even when we \nstarted we always did some origi­\nnals.

Which again is reminiscent of 1995, because back then \nJordan occupied a place in the field which was widely regarded \nas the leading pack chaser. \nBeing a fairly bright person (so Mammy says anyhow!) and \nhaving thought all this through I've come to the disturbing \nconclusion that the 1998 Formula season is in fact the most \ncunningly conceived sporting deceit since Maradonna threw \nthe ball in the back of the English net!!! Forget the World \nWrestling Federation and their less than wholesome antics, \nBernie Ecclestone (FI 's chief) has come up with the scam to \nbeat all scams. Having found that the whole chore of scooting \naround the world to organise 17 races each year was begin-\nning to become a bit of a drag on himself and his beloved \nteams he's gone and hired some techno whizz-kid to air brush \nhis old Beta copies of the 1995 Championship to make them \nlook like I 998's. So when we thought we were seeing \nFerrari's Michael Schumacher pull off onto the grass in \nAustralia we were in fact witnessing a much younger (and \nbluer) Shuey climbing out of his 1995 Bennetton Renault \nsomewhere north of London. The teams get to stay at home \nand do all that spending of Fortunes stuff, the sponsors \n(Benson and Hedges, Marlboro, Parmalat, etc .... ) still get their \nblanket media coverage and we punters are left w ith a race \ncalendar as authentic as the Spice Girls are exponents of High \nArt. \nOkay so its probably way off the mark, but in one sense a big \npart of me wishes it to be true. For if it were then we might \nescape the inevitable bore of watching McLaren win every sin­\ngle race, just as they so very nearly did ten years back when \nAyrton Senna was at the wheel. And even then they would \nhave bagged the lot but for an unfortunate incident involving a \nlarge sand trap and a very broken engine. Boring! Utterly \nBoring!! While its good to see Mclaren back on song, when \nthat tune is more than 2 seconds ahead of even their closest \nrival it doesn't bode well for the entertainment factor of the \nremaining season. No one enjoys sitting down to watch a \nsporting event if the result is almost entirely predictable, not \neven if their own hero/team is the one doing all the winning. \nThat's why when David Coulthard casually aired his hope that \nMika Hakkinen (the other Mclaren driver) would allow him \nto win the next race .... not attempt to, but actually to win .... I \nlet out a long slow moan, put my head in my hands and began \nto curse Adrian Newey for doing what he does best, design \ncars no one else can compete with. Only this time they are so \nfar ahead of everyone else that they effectively negate the \npresence of all the other teams. Boring! Stupid-mongously, \novertoppedly screwballed boring! Hopefully my pessimism will \nbe countered by an upturn in the fortune of all the other \nteams, a series races which are marvellously entertaining and \npossibly a a couple of drives down blind alleys for Hakkinen \nand Coulthard. Somehow though I can't see Adrian's new \nemployer doing a '95 on it.At least we still have CART on \nEurosport .....",

Now for those of us who love \nGrand Prix racing but have so far been entirely unsuccessful \nin attracting the collective eye of Formula One's various team \nmanagers or in even acquiring the very basic necessity of an \nFIA approved racing-licence this might just be a case of Ron \nDennis and Co . (the head guy at you know who) making our \nstep up from super-mini to super-car that bit easier. Why so? \nWell, because Mclaren, in all their glorious Mercedes funded \nwisdom, have decided that a certain member of the anony­\nmous public shall get a chance to strap themselves into this \ncar, to hold on tight and to get hurled around Silverstone in \nwhat has to be the world's most expensive taxi and all with­\nout he or she footing any sort of bill, tab or debt. \nIn association with Autosport magazine (avail­\nable from Easons of Patrick street or Gleesons of Glentworth \nstreet) Mclaren are running a simple postal competition \nwhereby we -the anonymous public -buy a copy of \nAutosport, write our name and address onto a specially \nenclosed postcard (which the magazine supplies), mail the \npostcard and hey presto a couple of weeks later Mika \nHakkinen rings up telling us we've won the trip of a life time \nand that Ron Dennis is looking forward to our visit. Couldn't \nbe more simple. Then again so is the Lotto but as yet I \nhaven't had any call to celebrate that either. Yet I'd be a fool \nto discount chance entirely, certain Satanic Cults and dodgy \nSooth Sayers have promised that with enough self mutilation, \ndegradation and the odd large donation to their always \nshort of the final figure building funds, our prayers, or \nshould that not be our post cards, will be answered. With \nwhat though, junk mail from Mclaren H.Q. entreating us to \ncomfort disappointment with a David Coulthard lamp shade \nor even a Mika Hakkinen commemorative soup ladel? I don't \nthink so. The fact of the matter is I stand the same chance as \neveryone else in this competition, which when the Abacus of \nLife finally Rickers to a standstill works out as pretty much \ndiddly squat. \nNo, despite all my admiration for Ron and his team's \nwacky two seater, I can't bring myself to enter his generously \noffered competition. Its one thing not to win a million squids \nevery third or fourth evening, but to have my one and only \nchance of ever sitting behind the wheel of an active contem­\nporary Formula One car (well I would be behind the driver \nand he'd be in front of the wheel) missing out on something \nas cool as this would be too much. Much too much . I'd pre­\nfer to read about John Nobody from Nothingham who \n'SUCCEEDED IN LAST WEEKS COMPETITION, WELL \nDONE JOHN' and to sit back in the sure knowledge that I \nwasn't in so I couldn't have won. And not being in I could \nhave no regrets, and having no regrets would ensure I \ncould forget the whole matter and in so forgetting I could \ncarry on with my life almost perfectly ignorant of that which \nI could never have had in the First place - a trip 'round the \nblock in a Mclaren. Now you may take exception to my \nlogic, you may even disagree with my pessimism, but I'd \nwager a month of \nyou're own income that no one from Limerick is going to \nwin. I guess, when all is said and won, this is just another \ncase of God awful post-modern rationalist thinking over­\ncoming my latenf lateral madcapness. I almost feel sorry for \nmyself. But for those of you with a bit more Romance in \nyou' re bones don't forget its Autosport Easons and \nGleesons and its off the shelves come Friday. I guess all \nthat's left to say is good luck, and lots of it, 'cause For sure \nyou'll damn well need it! @) • \nHANRATTYS \nEXCLUSIVE NITE CLIJB \nIRISH MUSIC \nTHURSDAY NIGHT \nFRIDAY NIGHT \nHANRA TTYS HOTEL \nGLENTWORTH STREET \n(061) 410999 \nID£RICCIE ®® 9~ 9 i®9~ 9 ffi®9~o \ndrop19",

          "text": ": I an emotional fish \nKnown to many as the band who wrote the song \"Celebrate\" An Emotional Fish performed \nin the Warehouse recently where they showed exactly what else they could play. DROP \nreporter, Micheal Duffy went along to the show and spoke to the lads •••••••• \nDuring the first half of the 90's,An Emotional Fish were \none of the leading lights of the Irish music scene, synonymous \nwith great live shows and their big hit which still gets a regular \nairing on radio, 'Celebrate'. \nHowever after a couple of great singles from their third \nand last album 'Sloper', they slowly slipped from the limelight \nand out. the back door of the attention hotel. \nYet you felt a band who perform so enthusiastically on \nstage could not resist the lure of the live circuit for too long \nand sure enough Ger Whelan and the boys are back on the \nroad, and visited Limerick's newest live venue, The Warehouse \non Friday June 19th. \nRelaxing backstage before the gig, Whelan explained the \nbands notable absence of late. \"Basically, we weren't enjoying it \nat the time, and we felt we weren't doing what we wanted to \ndo. The corporate influences were a bit strong and things \nkinda came to a halt.\" \nBreaking free of the corporate shackles, Whelan is \nrivalling in the bands new role. \"I was fed up being the clown, \nnow I want to be the ringmaster\". \n\"We're fishing in the back waters at the moment, taking \na different approach. Our familiar songs are going to sound dif­\nferent live, and there will be a nucleus of \nesting for us and the audience.\" \nComeback tours are often a trip down memory lane, \nbut not this one. \"Some new material is already recorded and \nwe will be playing a lot of it at the gigs. We've also recorded an \nElvis cover for a charity album so listen out for that.\" \nThe .easy going atmosphere back stage was very appar­\nent as the -boys took to the stage. Kieran Kennedy, another \nfamilar face from the early nineties replaced guitarist Dave \nFrew for the gig and slotted in with ease. Right from the styl­\nish beginning of separately introducing \"our compare for the \nevening\" (Ger Whelan of course), the band performed with \nconfidence and surety, making it simple for the crowd to enjoy. \nIts clear to see that this is what An Emotional Fish do, \nand enjoy, best. Whelan comes alive on stage, a born frontman \nwhose enthusiasm and showmanship spreads to involve the \ncrowd. \nAll the new tracks went down well, especially \"A.F.C. \nWake up call\" ( the T-rex influence certainly noticeable), while \ndrop16 \nold favourites like_ 'Rain' and \"Blue' jogged \nthe memory. \nThe crowd waited for 'Celebrate' and \nwere not disappointed. The drum'n'bass \nversion teased, before the band obliged \nwith the more familiar version. The crowd \npredictably, celebrated. \nComebacks are often ridiculed, out of \nretirement as a means to an end is the \ngeneral consensus. An Emotional Fish dis­\nregard the cliches, and just delight in the \nfact that they are back, playing to what will \nbe appreciative crowds if the Limer:ick gig \nis anything to go by. @",

Nigeria's defeat \nof Spain barely qualifies as Nigeria have been a dom­\ninant force in African football for many years now and \ndeclared to the world their intentions of kicking \nInternational ass back in USA '94 when they made it \nto the quarter finals. That's about it really .. unless you \ncount Iran beating the USA by two goals to one. Also \nthe days when the USA could be considered a Goliath \nof International football are many summers away. \nOtherwise any of the teams that one might have liked to \nsee topple one of the big boys have disappointed us as \nwell as themselves. Scotland showed that they simply don't \nhave it in crucial areas of the field. Their defence was too \nslow and tired by the time the nifty little Moroccans made \nshreds of it and the Scots lacked any cohesive punch up \nfront either. Jamaica's Reggae Boyz showed that all the \nheart and will to win in the World won't help if your team \nlacks basic football cop -on. Although they weren't \nhelped by a fussy ref dismissing one of their players early \non in their dash with Argentina. \nThere might be substance to the theory that there's one law \nfor the big boys and another law for the underdogs in that \nI've seen several minor image tackles -two by Italians, one \nby the English and another Brazilian one -totally ignored \nby the officials. \nCameroon, I thought had considerably less luck tan they \nhad talent. Though well beaten by the Italians they could \nand should have secured a place in the second round but \nhad what looked like a legitimate goal, disallowed in their \n1-1 draw with Chile. Consequently it will have been an \ndrop18 \nadmittedly useful looking Chile who had the snot kicked off \nthem by Brazil last Saturday week (I'm sticking my head \nout here again ... l'm writing this on the Wednesday prior to \nthe Chile Vrs Brazil game .) \nSo by the time this brand new \"DROP\" is piping hot off the \npress we'll be down to the last fo~r and the usua~ s~spects \nare already lining up to book their places and this Is \nbefore the group stage is over at all. \nDespite their Norwegian hiccup, I expect that Brazil will \nstill be there which will mean that they fought off Nigeria's \nSuper Eagles at the quarter finals stage. Italy being the \npoxy shower of gits that they' re will probably still be there \ntoo via a few penalty shoot outs -probably dumping the \nexciting host team of France out at the same stage. I'd like \nto think that my pre-tournament bet, Holland will still be \nthere too though they'll have to cross swords with their old \nnemesis the Germans en route. \nAt this point in time the team looking most likely to go all \nthe way from what I've seen, is Argentina. This I don't \nmind at all as I'll have £35 coming to me in a gentleman's \nwager if the Argies go all the way . They've shown that \nthey've the right blend of South American flair, North \nEuropean robust tackling and Mediterranean acting skills \nessential for winning those free kicks-to take them to the \nfinals. Also they have at least two lads, Batistuta and \nOrtega who know how to stick a ball in the back of the net \nand with frightening regularity as poor auld Jamaica will \ntestify. \nAnd finally what of England?? Sure haven't I just said \nArgentina will be there so we'll have waved bye bye to \nGlen Hoddle's boys at the airport quite a while ago. We'll \nhave newly Crowned World Champions by the next time, \nso till then!! @ • \nI \nr-",

Why so? \nWell, because Mclaren, in all their glorious Mercedes funded \nwisdom, have decided that a certain member of the anony­\nmous public shall get a chance to strap themselves into this \ncar, to hold on tight and to get hurled around Silverstone in \nwhat has to be the world's most expensive taxi and all with­\nout he or she footing any sort of bill, tab or debt. \nIn association with Autosport magazine (avail­\nable from Easons of Patrick street or Gleesons of Glentworth \nstreet) Mclaren are running a simple postal competition \nwhereby we -the anonymous public -buy a copy of \nAutosport, write our name and address onto a specially \nenclosed postcard (which the magazine supplies), mail the \npostcard and hey presto a couple of weeks later Mika \nHakkinen rings up telling us we've won the trip of a life time \nand that Ron Dennis is looking forward to our visit. Couldn't \nbe more simple. Then again so is the Lotto but as yet I \nhaven't had any call to celebrate that either. Yet I'd be a fool \nto discount chance entirely, certain Satanic Cults and dodgy \nSooth Sayers have promised that with enough self mutilation, \ndegradation and the odd large donation to their always \nshort of the final figure building funds, our prayers, or \nshould that not be our post cards, will be answered. With \nwhat though, junk mail from Mclaren H.Q. entreating us to \ncomfort disappointment with a David Coulthard lamp shade \nor even a Mika Hakkinen commemorative soup ladel? I don't \nthink so. The fact of the matter is I stand the same chance as \neveryone else in this competition, which when the Abacus of \nLife finally Rickers to a standstill works out as pretty much \ndiddly squat. \nNo, despite all my admiration for Ron and his team's \nwacky two seater, I can't bring myself to enter his generously \noffered competition. Its one thing not to win a million squids \nevery third or fourth evening, but to have my one and only \nchance of ever sitting behind the wheel of an active contem­\nporary Formula One car (well I would be behind the driver \nand he'd be in front of the wheel) missing out on something \nas cool as this would be too much. Much too much . I'd pre­\nfer to read about John Nobody from Nothingham who \n'SUCCEEDED IN LAST WEEKS COMPETITION, WELL \nDONE JOHN' and to sit back in the sure knowledge that I \nwasn't in so I couldn't have won. And not being in I could \nhave no regrets, and having no regrets would ensure I \ncould forget the whole matter and in so forgetting I could \ncarry on with my life almost perfectly ignorant of that which \nI could never have had in the First place - a trip 'round the \nblock in a Mclaren. Now you may take exception to my \nlogic, you may even disagree with my pessimism, but I'd \nwager a month of \nyou're own income that no one from Limerick is going to \nwin. I guess, when all is said and won, this is just another \ncase of God awful post-modern rationalist thinking over­\ncoming my latenf lateral madcapness. I almost feel sorry for \nmyself. But for those of you with a bit more Romance in \nyou' re bones don't forget its Autosport Easons and \nGleesons and its off the shelves come Friday. I guess all \nthat's left to say is good luck, and lots of it, 'cause For sure \nyou'll damn well need it! @) • \nHANRATTYS \nEXCLUSIVE NITE CLIJB \nIRISH MUSIC \nTHURSDAY NIGHT \nFRIDAY NIGHT \nHANRA TTYS HOTEL \nGLENTWORTH STREET \n(061) 410999 \nID£RICCIE ®® 9~ 9 i®9~ 9 ffi®9~o \ndrop19",

Back then Ireland was at the centre of this \nwonderful sport. Sean Kelly was always in the world's top \ntwo world cycling rankings. Roche had his record equalling \ntrilogy of wins in 1987. Martin Early was arguably the finest \nnon team leader cycling at the time and Paul Kimmage was \nblossoming into a fine professional rider. \nToday there is no Irish rider in the Continental Pro Peloton, Roche \nand Kelly have joined the list of former greats. Martin Early has \nbecome a mountain bike rider. Paul Kimmage is a journalist iso­\nlated from the sport he loves because of his courage to write a \nbook highlighting the dominance of drugs in cycling. The \nFederation of Irish cycling is a highly politicised body with \ndisharmony never too far from the surface. However the FIC has \na charismatic president in Pat McQuaid, the man who has done \nthe most to bring the Tour De France to Ireland. \nMcQuaid and Alan Ruston, his partner in L'Evenement (The com ­\npany organising the Tour in Ireland), have managed to secure \nfor Ireland it's biggest sports event ever. They were assisted by \nthe Dublin International Sports Council and also by the govern­\nment in making a case to have the tour here. Another important \nfactor was the support of the current race director, Jean Marie \nLeblanc, who covered the Nissan Classic in 1985 and 1986, \nhere he \"saw a lively race in a part of the world he hadn't seen \nbefore\". \nThe Tour will begin in Dublin on the 11th of this month with a \nPrologue (Time Trial) which will start outside Trinity College. It \nwill then weave its way through Nassau street, Stephen's Green \nand under Christ Church before finishing outside the GPO . This \nis a short circuit and a good braking will be as important as \nspeed for the riders here. \nStage one takes place the following day and will stretch over a \ndistance of 180.5km. It will begin at the GPO, but will be neu­\ntralised until Dundrum, here the real start commences. The Tour \nthen travels down to Arklow before turning up to Avoca, \nBlessington and Tallaght and it will finish up in the Pheonix park \nat around 4pm, 4 hours and 2o minutes after its start. \nThe second stage will leave Enniscorthy at 9am and travel along \nthe South coast during the 205.5 KM journey. This is an \nextremely difficult stage which encorporates the Sean Kelly sprint \nwhich will happen just after the climb of Carrick-on-Suir. The \nstage finishes at Victoria Cross in Cork. This stage should set the \nscene for the dominant riders to emerge. These riders include, \nRilis and Ullrich the winners of the last two tours. Then there are \nthe climbers like Zulle who is very good on the mountains. A fit \nOlano could pose a threat and the race is also very suited to a \nrider like Casagrande and don't forget Jalabert. \nIreland is well set to produce some really good racing according \nto Stephen Roche, \"The roads are narrow but it will be the first \ntime the riders haven't had to deal with round about\" So ironi­\ncally Ireland will have the safest touring roads. The roads should \nEscartin -one of the Tour's Climbers \nalso add excitement to the race because \"they are twisty which \nwill make it difficult for any team to organise a chase.\" Roche \nsaid. \nThere is a whole plethora of facts concerning the size of the tour \nbut if we just consider a few it will reAect the scale of the project. \nThree ships will help to carry the tour back to France from Cork. \nThere are also three chartered planes flying from Cork to Brest on \nthe return journey. There are 3500 accredited race personnel, \n1500 journalists, 200 photographers, 22 teams with nine riders \neach, 40 Gendarmerie assisted by l 000 Gardai and there will \nbe 104 broadcasting units following the race. The tour is expect­\ned to contribute £30 million to the economy. \nWhatever your interest in cycling, the atmosphere surrounding \nthe Tour's Ireland stages is sure to engulf you. So if you want to \nappear wise say convincingly that : \"Cipollini will win the first \nstage and Erik Zabel will win in Cork while Boardman and \nUllrich will do well in the time trial.\".@ \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the tour de france \nin Ireland \ndrop20 \n(",

          "text": "(,'_'R_E_-_c_o_o_P_E_R_-A_T=~=D_\" __ ) \nRonan Hennessy talks to local band \"Mysteries End \" \nin the return of the Limrock profiles. \nIn the insane \nclash of entities \nthat is \n\"Limrock\" only \nthose most \nenduring and \nprogressive \ncome to m ind. \n\"Mysteries End\" \nare a band who \nsuitably fit this \ncategory. In a \ntruthful analysis \ntheir music \nmaybe too dis­\ntinct for a self \ncontented local \nmusic scene. They are destined for much greater things. \nThe original line up of the band was formed in early '95 with \nGary Cooper on vocals. Their present vocalist and former gui­\ntarist Steve Fitz tells me that they originally started w ith a \nmelodic metal sound and following this, a string of early suc­\ncesses including reaching the semi-final of a local band com ­\npetition. They promptly recorded their first demo in Xeric stu­\ndios during the Summer of '96 with everyone contributing to \nthe bass tracks due to the· absence of a bass player. \nPossibly their greatest achievement though was the recording \nin Dublin of their perennial epic \"Starscorned\" included on the \nIrish metal compilation. This release gave the band the desired \nexposure which they backed up with a promotional gig in \nDublin venue, Slattery's where Steve explains they were very \nwell received. That was a hectic day for the band with appear­\nances in both Limerick and Dublin. They started with the music \nexpo in Arthur's Quay Park joined by over twenty other Limerick \nbands. These events were to be a turning point for the band \nwho realised their true potential would be found in a change of \nstyle. The departure of Gary Cooper m~ant Steve Fitz becan:ie \nthe band's vocalist. The current line-up Is as follows, Steve Fitz \nis on vocals, Alan O 'Connell on guitar, Sean O 'Brien on bass \nand Keith McCoy on drums. \nSteve attributes the diverse musical influences, ranging from \nFaith No More to Cannibal Corpse, to the line-up change . It \nwould therefore be difficult to pigeon hole the band's music due \nto the many complexities involved, but somehow I would \ndescribe it as improvised, operatic metal. \nThere are however many certainties about the band, for exa~­\nple their music's intoxicating nature and als? the fact that their \ndrummer Keith McCoy is without exaggeration one of the best \ndrummers I have ever seen or heard perform. \nAs well as older songs such as \"Starscorned\" and \"My _ Velvet \nCreation\" their current repertoire includes new songs like the \npowerful \"Cutting Edge\" and even a few acoustic numbers such \nas \"Sometimes\". With this whole new element a successful \ncomeback seems assured when play Costelloe's on \nWednesday, July 8th. \"My Friend Judas\". playing a_s support \nshould make he night a worthy of a mark m _y~ur ~Iary. \n\"As far as playing in Limerick, you're pretty limited , says Steve, \n\"There is definitely a lack of proper venues, bands should be \ndrop21 \ncatered for more professionally\" \nJudging by their musical credentials alone and not on any other \npretence , this Mysteries End gig is not to be missed by any \nself-respecting music lover. The band intend to record the per­\nformance for demo purposes. They will try and capture the \nessence of live performances on the recording -something that \nis difficult to convey in studio demos . This should help bring \nincreased recognition of the band's progression since the \nadvent of new material and the recent line-up change. \n\"Limrock\" continues, so catch it while it's hot. \nMysteries End play with My Friend Judas, July the eighth at \nCostelloe's. Admission is free and the doors open at eight o' \nclock. \nIf you are in a local band and would like to be included in the \n\"Limrock\" profiles send information, contact numbers and /or a \ndemo for the band to DROP Magazine 67-68 Catherine Street \nLimerick. \nThe first of a number of features on essential releases \nof the 1990's by Ollie Gleeson ..... \n\" . \n-■a~ \n....,..;,,,,;-.,.,,...._/·\\:r · . \n/ ' .. ;' - • • • • dl99J't:rt:i1r~·~c., \n,.!,_·, ,· •.•.• ... __:•_ •• :. , ,;f, . \nCRACKER : KEROSENE HAT. \nWhen David Lowery's 'Camper Van Beethoven' crashed on tour \nin 1989, he needed a new vehicle to carry his skewed philoso­\nphy to the world. To this end he set up Cracker with his long \ntime friend John Hickman. From 1992 to 1996 they released \nthree albums: Cracker, Kerosene Hat and·The Golden Age but \nin a sense Cracker's 'golden age' arrived with the release of \nKerosene Hat. \nLowery never lost the eccentricities of his Camper Van days \nand this is obvious by the fact that this CD carries an amazing \n99 tracks, most of which however consist only of three sec­\nonds of silence. Lost amongst the static is track 88, Eurotrash \nG irls with a wit and a chorus which will stay with you long \nafter.Pee Pee and Poo Poo have gone to bed. The two singles \n\"Low\" and \"Get Off This\" along with the caustic \"Movie Star'' are \ngrunge laden and paranoid yet rest comfortably alongside the \ninfectious country nonsense of \"Sweet Potato\" and the epic gui­\ntar ballad \"I Want Everything\" (what Counting Crows' \nWalkaways would sound like if they ever finished it.) Throw in a \nGrateful Dead cover i.e. \"Loser'' and a 40 second slice of distor­\ntion i.e. Hi-Desert Biker Meth Lab (basically some nutter with a \nhammer who falls asleep!) and you have one of the most \nessential albums of the Nineties. @)",

Now for those of us who love \nGrand Prix racing but have so far been entirely unsuccessful \nin attracting the collective eye of Formula One's various team \nmanagers or in even acquiring the very basic necessity of an \nFIA approved racing-licence this might just be a case of Ron \nDennis and Co .

The gist of FERG I E's grief with LEEDS supporters is - he claims - that there is so much hatred concentrated on the away team and their fans when they visit LEEDS UTD., at ELLAND RD., that he just wishes LEEDS would be relegated. Awwww! .... Poor Fergie .... We hurt his feelings ... We intimidated that poor man with our over enthusiastic cheering. Maybe us LEEDS fans sho",

Guests are greeted by the \ncurator, stepping across threshold : Smiles, warm hand­\nshakes, murmured welcomes. The click of footfalls, clink of \nwine glasses, the gentle flow of conversation. In the limelight \nstands the artist : Praise if past, thanks returned. \nNew dty, new launch, same exhibition, and all is running \nwell. \nIt is so easy to believe that even wh11e Rome wasn't \nbuilt in a day, new art in a new venue can be erected in \nless. This is owed to the galleries and artists who work \nhard in maintaining an exhibition's primary aim which is \nto display work so as to reveal the merit of actual con­\ntent (as if an exhibitions aim could be anything else!), \nso creating a show which is simple and accessible in its \npresentation. By this end they allow exhibition viewers \nthat gift of enjoying art as it should be enjoyed -with­\nout pretensions and for personal pleasure. However , \nthe fact that so many artists shed sweat, tears and long, \nlong months of pushing proposals and accepting \nrefusals, when trying to put an exhibition together \nshould never be forgotten. Nor should the fact that \nmany of the exhibitions brought to our local galleries \nare done so through the personal funding of the artist \nhim/herself. without even a far-off promise of state \ngrant-aid. be brushed aside. \nThe latest exhibition to pass through the Belltable \nportals is a touring exhibition of paintings by Sinead \nNi Chionaola and photographs by Carmel \nCleary. and one that. up until recently - (and like so many \nother shows that have graced the same gallery walls) - received \nno Arts Council funding whatsoever. \n\"When we decided to take on the exhibition we didn't realise \nhow much work was going to be involved,\" claims Carmel, who \nteamed up with Sinead in the Crawford College of Art, Cork. \n\"It took about a year of planning and organising before we actu­\nally started touring it. It was launched in Dublin by John Hunt \nof the Hunt Museum in Limerick, then it went to Wexford , now \nLimerick and it's last stop in Ireland will be Cork. We hope to \nget it co the Festival of Art in Adelaide, Australia, and Sinead is \nin Los Angeles at the moment trying co organise getting it over \nthere. If we can pull chat off it will be great!\" she laughs. \"I \nmean. you have co try because nobody else is going co do it for \nyou.\" \nThe exhibition entitled 'Explorations', has already \nreceived much critical acclaim nationally and to be viewed on \nother continents would be beneficial not only to the artists \nthemselves but to Irish art in general. \n_.,, \n.,.. __ ,_ Mean'n'Mood:, mode for Miker,......, H , \nWalter Macken·• 'Home I■ The ero • \n' i-lJ1 DJJ . \nComplimenting Island Theatre Companv · s J ~ ~ Lll1l-\nm er season, a charming, often witty, c1lmn!'t dncu nenlc1I. \nexhibition of photographs and pnster~ ot 1·;:in nu• I\"' L'd \nproductions is now on show in Chimes Restaurant \ndown stairs at the Belltable Arb Ce ntre.

My work is all rock formation and \nthough it's just 'rock' I guess I'm.trying to suggest something \nslightly different by echoing human form. I don 't know: It's my \nview of the world I suppose! And though I don't have any mes­\nsage co tell . I mean , this work is something I do for myself. if \npeople learn to see a little bit differently through looking at my \nphotographs then fair enough. That's greac.\" \nW ith Carmel's work in monochrome and Sinead's brightly \ncoloured, the visual impact is startling but again these two \npolarities work well to complement. \n\"They're hung in sets of maybe three of mine and two of \nSineads, one of mine and three of Sineads -and they actually \nform a little dialogue between themselves,'' explains Carmel. \n\"We 've noticed since we 've been touring the exhibition that \nmore and more of the pieces have similarities which we didn't \nnotice at the beginning. We didn't do the work \ntogether - I live in Waterford and Sinead in Cork -buc \nwe really do seem to be in tune with each other on \nchis one anyway.\" \nA second combined show for the future 1s being \nmulled over, though for the moment . the two anises \nare intent on touring chis exhibition co as many venues \nas possible. \n\"The exhibition is called 'Explorations' and . while we \nhad to pick something that suited both our work. che \ntitle also came out of the face chat it was an explo­\nration actually having to work together - both in the \narcwork and behind the scenes, putting che whole \nshow together and getting it one the road. \" \nAnd with much extended praise co the cwo women - re \nnow remains on the road : New city, new launch, same \neXhibition .... and most definitely, all is running well. \n('Explorations' will be officially opened at the \nBelltable Arts Centre by Albert Higgins, Artis­\ntic Director of the Midlands Arts Resource \nCentre, this evening Thursday 3 August. It will \ncontinue in the Gallery until Saturday 26 \nAugust. For further details 06 I /3 I 9866) \nBy Siobhan Colgan \nI ; \n' \nND ]l][]F",

          "raw_text": "Thursday August 3rd·-Wednesday A:ugusfloth• L\"II ERICK EVENTS -UU 111 E • -\nSl~ll ••••••••• \nSomewhere in Clubland Darren Emerson is tearing it up on the decks. He 's chasing hard house \nw1.th pummelling techno. Track after track crunches through the huge speakers. The cro;d are \ngomg wild. They know Darren's out for the kill but they don 't mind being the victims~ Darren \nEmerson .is not hailed by Melod y Maker as ·'TJie world's best yo1111g club DJ\". for nothing. The \ntrack spmmng 1s moving towards a splintering breakdown but Darren wants to hurt the crowd \nharde~. He knows how he's going to do it too. Smiling, he drops 'Born Slippy', Underworld 's lech­\nno-Jungle headrush. It's a track he knows inside out. Why wouldn't he ? Like so m any other of \nUnderworld's tunes. this is one made especially for him . \nSo.mewhere in ;;:n -Essex wo~kspace Karl Hyd eissiftingt hro~gh-a s~ries of photogi°aphs. T hey-;-;:~ \ntor his n~xt book - a collection of words , pictures and artwork on Western Europe's sprawling \nmetropolis. London . His first book on New York. 'Mmm, Skyscraper I Love You'. has already \nproved successful in artbook stores. with HMVand Virgin also scurrying 10 stock ii on their \nshelves. Karl's delighted with it's popularity. He brought it out quietly amid a rush of public and \npress interest concerning another artistic facet of his life - his band Underworld . If it's a succe s \nthen he's sure it is so because of the books ow n merits - not because Underwo rld's debut album \n'D11bN0BassWithMyHeadMa11', for the Junior Bo ys 011111 label, reached No . 12 in the British \ncharts when it was released in January ·94 and has since been hailed as one of the mo st important \nalbums since 'Screamadelica '. He hopes this next book will glean him equal satisfaction - Equ al \nsatisfaction also to the T .Y . commercials , the P.C. document aries and the advertisino artwork he \nand fellow Underworld partner and college buddy , Rick Smith , are working on toget~er with other \ncomrad es of the long-standing Tomat o Co-Op . H e hopes too that he. Rick and D arren will have a \nblast when they play their first ever Irish gig at Feile next weekend -They 're in the m ood for \nsomething new . \nUnderworld . People scratch their heads. brows \nfurrowed. at the bands m ention. Oh. they know \nthe tracks : The most recent wonderfully mu si­\ncally perverse 'Born Slippy', \\993's 'Rez.' \n( .. E very 11 011· a11d the11 a record com es along \nthat is so different that it mak es you question \nho 11 · good everythi11g else really is\" - M ixma g \nJune \"93) and it's llipside 'Cowgi rl'. that same \nyear\"s S umm er soundtrack. Th ey know the \nremixes too : Simply Red 's 'Thrill Me '. \nWilliam Orbit's 'Water From a Vine Leaf \nand the Chemical Brother s 'Leave Hom e' \n(\"Th at's the one rha1 makes m e laugh - Speed \nMetal full-on! Ye s!\" - Karl. quote. unquote). \nSome mi gh t also know that Underworld - as the \nHyde and Smith partnership - have been around \nfor 15 years. that they were first called Freuer, \nan clctro-rock-pop-ish-type-combo who put out \na couple of albums with CBS , that they support­\ned Eurythmics on their farewell stadium tour \nor America and that they finally rid themselves \nof all other musicians in 1990. teamed up with \nDarren Emerson. turntable boywonder and \nlocal lad on the Essex partyscene, and proceed­\ned to make danceland hysteria ... and possible \nhistory. \nBui you still scratch your head. \nYou see. il doesn't really matter how much \ninformation you gather on Underworld. Musi­\ncally the band are writing their own secret plot. \nYou may think you 've fingered the plan today. \nbut you can bet two technics and a mixer with \ncrossfader. that by tomorrow they'll have \nreversed their whole musical agenda. \n\"There's no particular sound to Underworld . \nThe inspiration for everything w~ produce is \nthat it's ·groove-Jed' - but that's it.\" explains \nKarl. \"You could say there's three sides IO us. \nMayhc that would explain our music better. \nOne ~ide is that we make records for Darren to \nplay in his set. So we make. specifically, clu~­\noriented records. leading from the current lip \nthat Darren's on. Then there are the albums that \nwe make. They can be more dynamic.You \nknow - they can be mellow. kicking. have lots \nof words. they can have whatever in them. Then \nthere's the live performance w hich starts to \nbecome another thing altogether.\" \nIt would also be difficult to pinpoint the band's \nmu sical agenda from Karl's affirmed inllu­\nences, as they range from Miles Da vis and Cap­\ntain Beefuean to various advertising executives \nand graphic designer at the Tomato Co-Opera­\nti ve in his adop ted hometown of E s ex. And \nyet, even in saying this. it' probably the Toma­\nto connection as a who le that best explains \nwhere exactly Underwo rld are com ing from - if \nnot where they are going to. \n\"Tom ato is so important to us. It's a bit like a \ncreative think-tank, if you like. where we m ake \ntelevision commer cials. sculptures. films. the \nbooks, document aries .... Oh yeah - and mu sic! \nWe formed at the end of the '80s. A little group \nof us - about eight people. So m e from college. \nsome self-emplo yed. some wh o'd been employ­\ning others - came together very disillu ioned \nwith all that had gone on in that last decade and \nsaid, 'Look. why don 't we just rent a space \ntogether and, y'know. start working together·. \nSo we did and it just went on from there. We \nstarted off doing record sleeves - which we \ndon 't really do any more - and then moved into \nnewspaper based things and T.V . commercials \nand that got more and·-more well known . Occa ­\nsionally Rick or me or Darren will do the mu sic \nfor the ads or provide the artwork for· them and \nit's really nice knowing that you've got peopk \nfrom very .varied walks of life coUaborating on \neach other's work.\"' \nThis diversity in the band's 9 to 5 routine mu st \nbe the key or. al least. part of puzzle that is their \ndiversity in musical sound too and must surely \nallow for their reappearance and their reappear­\nance after that, as clubland top cats. \n\"Oh definitely.\" agrees Karl. \"I me an. just \ntowards the end of last year we kind of rea1:hcd \na saturation point in playing live. We did a lot or \nJive gigs and we fell like we were getting away \nfrom the ability to be subtle. It was getting a bit \ntoo 'kicking' and it was just like a meter that \ngoes 100 far into one thing or 1·00 far into anoth­\ner. So we spent 6 months being in studio. mak-\n~ · ··········•···FEILE · \n011 What you LookJ.n' at? Ain't you eTI:r seen technoheads \nwiv hair before?! \ning art and writing. Then when we went out and \nplayed again it was great. It was like-blowing \nall the cobwebs away . \n··1t has to be like that because sometimes we get • \nbored or we think we're getting boring anp so \nwe immerse ourselves in something else, some \nother art. That keeps it interesting and it encour­\nages us to be individual people. to do things that \nwe need to do - Not to have to do everything \nthrough Underworld or not to have to be 'Dar­\nren Emerson - World Shattering DJ' - You can \ndraw pictures as well. Darren, if you like!!\" \nBut don 't be deceived : Tomato - while very \nimportant to Karl. Nick and Darren - is only \npart of the Underworld equation. It doesn't \nexplain the whole plot. There are sub-plots and \nsub-scenes, others areas of the trio's life that \nover the 15 years that Karl and Nick have been \ntogether and the last five years that have seen \nDarren build on the band's reputation, have \nbrought Underworld to where they. are today. \nAnd who knows what future experiences are \ngoing to take them into tomorrow's music. One \nA\nKarl won't allow is for Underworld 10 \nleaders of that tomorrow. \n, \n··we'll be part of it. I hope . but no m ore th:111 \nthat. People have said som e very large thing, \nabout us and that's been very encouraging. But \nI don't really think about those things a, all \nbecause we get our inspiration from jm,l ,o \nmany different people - people who will go \nunsung for a long time. \n\"Our secret - if you REALLY want to know :· \ngrins Karl. \"is just to have a laugh. To 1play \nwhatever music we want to play al the time. nnt \nto pander to our own or anyone else·s image of \nourselves ar.d just to have a laugh. I read some ­\nwhere that somebody said \"Having fun is a seri­\nous business'\" and I think that's really true. ii \nis! Having a laugh isn't shallow.

UTD., boss, ALEX FERGUSON, \ndropped himself neck high in the brown stuff \nlast week when it was discovered that he made \nsome ridiculous comments about LEEDS \nUNITED - and in particular, their supporters -\nin his crappy book (the title of which I'm not \ngoing to mention because he's not getting a \nfr~e plug from me). The gist of FERG I E's grief \nwith LEEDS supporters is - he claims - that \nthere is so much hatred concentrated on the \naway team and their fans when they visit \nLEEDS UTD., at ELLAND RD., that he just \nwishes LEEDS would be relegated. Awwww! .... \nPoor Fergie .... We hurt his feelings ... We \nintimidated that poor man with our over \nenthusiastic cheering. Maybe us LEEDS fans \nshould get some MAN UTD ., supporters to \nteach us some \"real\" football songs ... Like \nthat \"really funny\" song MAN UTD., fans \nchant at LIVERPOOL supporters about the \nHILLSBROUGH disaster. That would be nice. \nNo doubt FERGIE will be delighted to hear \nthat the first meeting of the Limerick branch \nof the LEEDS UNITED SUPPORTERS CLUB \ntook place last week in THE HORSE AND \nHOUND on MULGRAVE STREET. The first \ncouple of objectives for the club was to get our \nofficial recognition and all that jazz, and the \nnext move was to sort out an away trip which \nwe've done : LEEDS visit SHELBOURNE in \nDUBLIN next THURSDAY 11 AUGUST and \nthere'll be a bus travelling to and from the \ngame, departing from SPAIGHTS at 4.00PM \non THURSDAY AFTERNOON. \nThe next meeting of the LEEDS UNITED \nSUPPORTERS CLUB is on MONDAY 21 \nAUGUST in the HORSE AND HOUND, \nwhere we'll all be watching the LEEDS V'S \nLIVERPOOL game on SKY.
