This is not the place to go into minute details as to how that end may be accomplished ; as, apart from the question of tactics, it would take up too much space, but one of the remedies may be referred to in brief. It is well known that at the present moment the Athletic Council holds hundreds of applications from members of the other bodies for reinstate- ment to the National Association, and that amongst the appli- cants aré numerous champions and ex-champions; men who must be relied on to make up international teams. Why not, under certain conditions, give these men a trial, or, in other words, reinstate them, or at all events reinstate such of them as the Council have sufficient faith in to adhere to their pledges? There is no crime in taking into the fold men who have seen the error of their ways, whether from a purely national standpoint or whether from the selfish standpoint of being enabled to compete with the alien Association. Through this medium I am convinced we could secure at least seventy-five per cent. of the alien bodies’ membership, and thus, while Associations without members may be objects to commiserate with, théy could scarcely be considered potent for good or evil. With the decks cleared of such bodies which have never reflected any credit on Ireland, and have always been prepared to relegate her to a position of obscurity as was instanced at the last Olympic games, the G.A.A. could go to the representatives of foreign countries, and, without fear of refusal, claim for Ireland her rightful place amongst the athletic nations of the world. This is one of my ideas to effect our athletic freedom; if it does not commend itself to others, let us have their schemes, for all will admit it does not brook delay. There can be no compromise, and there certainly can- not be any peace, until some Association or Associations go under, and that Association cannot be the G.A.A.",

We\nhave been sparring now for some years, and it is nearly time we\ncame to hard blows. This is not the place to go into minute\ndetails as to how that end may be accomplished ; as, apart from\nthe question of tactics, it would take up too much space, but one\nof the remedies may be referred to in brief. It is well known\nthat at the present moment the Athletic Council holds hundreds\nof applications from members of the other bodies for reinstate-\nment to the National Association, and that amongst the appli-\ncants aré numerous champions and ex-champions; men who\nmust be relied on to make up international teams. Why not,\nunder certain conditions, give these men a trial, or, in other\nwords, reinstate them, or at all events reinstate such of them as\nthe Council have sufficient faith in to adhere to their pledges?\nThere is no crime in taking into the fold men who have seen the\nerror of their ways, whether from a purely national standpoint\nor whether from the selfish standpoint of being enabled to\ncompete with the alien Association. Through this medium\nI am convinced we could secure at least seventy-five\nper cent. of the alien bodies’ membership, and thus,\nwhile Associations without members may be objects to\ncommiserate with, théy could scarcely be considered potent\nfor good or evil. With the decks cleared of such bodies\nwhich have never reflected any credit on Ireland, and have\nalways been prepared to relegate her to a position of obscurity\nas was instanced at the last Olympic games, the G.A.A. could\ngo to the representatives of foreign countries, and, without fear\nof refusal, claim for Ireland her rightful place amongst the\nathletic nations of the world. This is one of my ideas to effect\nour athletic freedom; if it does not commend itself to others,\nlet us have their schemes, for all will admit it does not brook\ndelay. There can be no compromise, and there certainly can-\nnot be any peace, until some Association or Associations go\nunder, and that Association cannot be the G.A.A.",

Phil Casey, a native of Mountrath, Queen’s County, was the first to make handball popular. He beat Barney McQuade for the American Championship in 1868. He retained this honour until 1897, when he resigned in favour of Fitzgerald of Tralee. Casey played all over the country with James Dunne, formerly of Athy, as partner. The personality of both men,.and the high class exhibitions which characterized their play, made the game very popular. They made trips to Ireland, and were familiar with the Mexican exponents of the game—Pelota, one of the national sports of Spain and Latin America. Casey played up to his death a few years ago.

Th e first plc1 y I wro te ni ht the place was packed with all the people I used to \nw~rk with, with my friends, and I could und~rstand, \nPlaywright Bernard Farrell \ntook nine m onths and it was literally like a pregna ncy and \nbirth.

I'll probably never go near it again \nand I don't know if I've even taken any ideas from it. \nWhat do you think of Irish theatre today? \nI think it's very healthy. 1 think the m ajor playwrights are \nstill turning out good w orks and - as important - I think \nthat a lot of theatre comp anies are now going out to play­\nw rights, asking them to w rite plays for them which is \ngreat, and holding their hand throughout. 1 mean, loo k at \nRed Kettle. This, Happy Birthday D ear Alice, 1s the second \nplay I've written for them , the first being Forty Fo11r \nSyca111ore. l really loved working with th.em : They were so \ngenerous and caring and willing to take a chance. A lot of \ntheatre compani es are afraid, wondering will a commi s­\nsioned play work out but nobod y will know unless they \ntry and Red Kettle really went for it. 1 honestly think that \nat this m oment in time they are one of. the best theatre \ncompanie s in the country. • \nOf all the plays you've written, which is your favourite? \nThe last one is always ·the favourite. Wouldn't it be terrible \nif you had written 14 plays and you kept thinking \"Oh, the \nfifth\", or \"the second\", were the best! No -Definitely, my \nfavourite at the moment is 'Happy Birtl,day Dear Alice'. \nINTERVIEW: SIOBHAN COLGAN \n(Happy Birtltday Dear Alice opens at the Bell table Arts \nCentre on Monday 6 March and runs until Saturd·ay 18 \nMarch.

I t can \nsew the knif e in a way i \nthat you d oi,tt feel \n\\ \" it .. \nmoment of glory, because L----------------------' \nls this wh y yo u turned to com­\nedy ? \nYes it is though it was n't that I \nreally 'turned' to com edy, I just \ncouldn't do .1nyth1ng else. If \nsom ebody p u t a gun to m y \n-herid ,an d sn id, \"Write \" \ntragedy \", I probably couldn't \n. ..

On the first take you to write a play ? . \nWell, I try to do w ork from nine to five every day. certa111-\nly l w ould do som e wo rk every day. Th e first plc1 y I wro te ni ht the place was packed with all the people I used to \nw~rk with, with my friends, and I could und~rstand, \nPlaywright Bernard Farrell \ntook nine m onths and it was literally like a pregna ncy and \nbirth. Since then I 've wo rked it out that it takes app roxi­\nm ately nine m onths to w rite each of them . \nYou 've done a lot of work for radio and television. What \nwas that like? \nI love doing stuff for radio. I find that mu ch easier thc1n \nwriting for stage. Television was great too. I really enjoyed \nwriting for 'C/e11roe' but l actually enjoyed it too mu ch ! I \ndidn't think I was going to stay w ith it for as long as I did \n-l was with it for 3 years. A n d by the end of the three years \nthere we re so m any plays I knew I had to get back to wr it-\ning. _ \nAnd the novel ? Will that ever be completed ? \nO h I Th e boring novel ! It's in a ·drawer some w here and 1 \nstill do n't think I w ould be prepared to look at it now -I'd \nbe so emb arrassed ! I'll probably never go near it again \nand I don't know if I've even taken any ideas from it. \nWhat do you think of Irish theatre today? \nI think it's very healthy. 1 think the m ajor playwrights are \nstill turning out good w orks and - as important - I think \nthat a lot of theatre comp anies are now going out to play­\nw rights, asking them to w rite plays for them which is \ngreat, and holding their hand throughout. 1 mean, loo k at \nRed Kettle. This, Happy Birthday D ear Alice, 1s the second \nplay I've written for them , the first being Forty Fo11r \nSyca111ore. l really loved working with th.em : They were so \ngenerous and caring and willing to take a chance. A lot of \ntheatre compani es are afraid, wondering will a commi s­\nsioned play work out but nobod y will know unless they \ntry and Red Kettle really went for it. 1 honestly think that \nat this m oment in time they are one of. the best theatre \ncompanie s in the country. • \nOf all the plays you've written, which is your favourite? \nThe last one is always ·the favourite. Wouldn't it be terrible \nif you had written 14 plays and you kept thinking \"Oh, the \nfifth\", or \"the second\", were the best! No -Definitely, my \nfavourite at the moment is 'Happy Birtl,day Dear Alice'. \nINTERVIEW: SIOBHAN COLGAN \n(Happy Birtltday Dear Alice opens at the Bell table Arts \nCentre on Monday 6 March and runs until Saturd·ay 18 \nMarch. It follows another llERNARD FARRELL stage \nplay Tire Last Apaclte Re1111io11 which continues at the \nBell,table until Saturday 4 March. Details on (061) \n319866) \n-•· . .. '",

Now with his most recently penned prize, 'Happy Birthday Dear Alice', (com­\nmissioned and produced by Waterford's RED KETTLE Theatre Company), opening at the BELL TABLE \nthis J\\1onday, the L.E.G. scooped a few moment .s of the stage maestro's time and discovered why he \njumped career ship, shrugs off claims of \"lightweight\" work and believes he'll never ever find fame as a \nwriter of books. \nIn 1979 you were working with Sealink. In 1980 you \nwere a full-time playwright. How did this move come \nabout? \nWell, in 1979 l wrote my first play - a play called 'I Do Not \nLike Ti,ee Dr. Fell'. I didn't know who to send it to so I \nthought, \"I may as well start at the rop and send it to the \nAbbey,\" not actually thinking anything would happen to \nit. But, any,.vay, they accepted it and it went on in the Pea­\ncock in '79 and then it transferred to the Abbe y. By that \nti..rne 1 haci starteci to wr ite m v ,;econd play, 'Canaries'. N ow \nin 1980, I was walking ac;oss Abbe y Street in Dublin, \nheading back to work at North Wall and 1 met Joe Dowlin g \nwho was Artistic Director of the Abbe y at the time. He said \nto me, \"We have your second pla_, 'Ca11aries'. We 've been \nreading it. We like it. And w e w ant to put it on in The \nAbbey as part of the Dub lin T heatre Festival. ls that all \nright with you !\" Well, yes ! believe me - it wa s quite all \nright ! So I went straight dcwT, to Sealink from there and. \nhanded _ in my resignation. \nDid you ever regret that decision? \nNo . Never . Even though it w as a great.step - I had been \nworking there for 15 years and this meant leaving it w ith­\nout a pension, without all the free travel, without anything \nat all except one play down and another play abo~t tog~ \non -what actually happened after that w as that basically, -\nw r te a play every year. A lot of this was dow n to Joe \nDowlin g because he was extremely encouraging and as \nsoon as Canaries went on and was successful, he then com­\n\"Right ! they're all here because it's O pening Nig ht but \nw ho's go ing to be here tom orrow night ?!\" A nd it just \nama zed m e that for the next 6 wee ks the play packed out \nthe Peacock, l w as staggered by that. T hen it m n.ved to T he \nAbb ey whi ch is a 700 seater and it d id great there ton -I'm \nalw ays ama zed at all-these wo nderful strangers w ho com e \nto see m y plays ! \nDid you always harbour ambition s to be a playwright ? \nNo - but I harboured amb itions to be a w riter. From the \ntim e I w as·in school l was w riting short stories and poetry \nfor various news papers but l wa s collecting mor e rejection \nslips than getting stories published I Th en l started to wr ite \na novel and \\ wa s half wa y through that bu t it w as really \nboring m e• 'And if it was boring m e , and l w as w riting it, \nGo d only knows wha t it wa s going tn do to others w ho \nmight read it ! I suppose what i was trying to do w as find \nthe right m edium in w hich to w ork. Th en by sheer chance \nthere wa s a theatre wo rkshop wi th L,rntern Theatre in \nDubl i1i and l went along to that and thought m aybe I \nshould try and w rite a play. And I d id. \nYour work , on occasion, ha s b een d escribed a s \n• 'lightweight'. How do you feel about that? \nW ell, 1 don't min d that at all. I think that all the plays are \nquite d ifferent. So m e of them a re deep and harrow ing. and \nsom e of them are just fun, bu f all of them are com edies. I \nthink a lot of connotations are formed w hen critics go to \nthe theatre and if they hear the audience laughing, imm e-\nd iately think _that this is som eone w ho's telling jokes -\nmissioned a play a year from-----------------------, \nme for the Abbey and I did 99 \nthat for three years.\" ••• Comedy can often \nWh ich is to misinterpret what \ncom ed y is all about. Come dy \ncan often be a weapon . It can \nsew the krnfe in in a way that \nyou don't feel it. How did you feel about your \nvery first play premiering at \nThe Abbey? \nYe s, having your first play to \nbe premiered in the N ational \nTheatre is quite an ach ieve­\nment. It was a scream , \nthough. You see, before the \nplay opene~d I was \nannouncing it, advertising it, I \nalways felt \"this is my \nbe a weapon . I t can \nsew the knif e in a way i \nthat you d oi,tt feel \n\\ \" it .. \nmoment of glory, because L----------------------' \nls this wh y yo u turned to com­\nedy ? \nYes it is though it was n't that I \nreally 'turned' to com edy, I just \ncouldn't do .1nyth1ng else. If \nsom ebody p u t a gun to m y \n-herid ,an d sn id, \"Write \" \ntragedy \", I probably couldn't \n. .. Thou gh if they had a gun to \nm y head - I'd probably try 1 \nHow long would it u sually \nonce the play opens every- . \nbody will see what a load of rubbish it is !''. On the first take you to write a play ? . \nWell, I try to do w ork from nine to five every day. certa111-\nly l w ould do som e wo rk every day. Th e first plc1 y I wro te ni ht the place was packed with all the people I used to \nw~rk with, with my friends, and I could und~rstand, \nPlaywright Bernard Farrell \ntook nine m onths and it was literally like a pregna ncy and \nbirth. Since then I 've wo rked it out that it takes app roxi­\nm ately nine m onths to w rite each of them . \nYou 've done a lot of work for radio and television. What \nwas that like? \nI love doing stuff for radio. I find that mu ch easier thc1n \nwriting for stage. Television was great too. I really enjoyed \nwriting for 'C/e11roe' but l actually enjoyed it too mu ch ! I \ndidn't think I was going to stay w ith it for as long as I did \n-l was with it for 3 years. A n d by the end of the three years \nthere we re so m any plays I knew I had to get back to wr it-\ning. _ \nAnd the novel ? Will that ever be completed ? \nO h I Th e boring novel ! It's in a ·drawer some w here and 1 \nstill do n't think I w ould be prepared to look at it now -I'd \nbe so emb arrassed ! I'll probably never go near it again \nand I don't know if I've even taken any ideas from it. \nWhat do you think of Irish theatre today? \nI think it's very healthy. 1 think the m ajor playwrights are \nstill turning out good w orks and - as important - I think \nthat a lot of theatre comp anies are now going out to play­\nw rights, asking them to w rite plays for them which is \ngreat, and holding their hand throughout. 1 mean, loo k at \nRed Kettle. This, Happy Birthday D ear Alice, 1s the second \nplay I've written for them , the first being Forty Fo11r \nSyca111ore. l really loved working with th.em : They were so \ngenerous and caring and willing to take a chance. A lot of \ntheatre compani es are afraid, wondering will a commi s­\nsioned play work out but nobod y will know unless they \ntry and Red Kettle really went for it. 1 honestly think that \nat this m oment in time they are one of. the best theatre \ncompanie s in the country. • \nOf all the plays you've written, which is your favourite? \nThe last one is always ·the favourite. Wouldn't it be terrible \nif you had written 14 plays and you kept thinking \"Oh, the \nfifth\", or \"the second\", were the best! No -Definitely, my \nfavourite at the moment is 'Happy Birtl,day Dear Alice'. \nINTERVIEW: SIOBHAN COLGAN \n(Happy Birtltday Dear Alice opens at the Bell table Arts \nCentre on Monday 6 March and runs until Saturd·ay 18 \nMarch. It follows another llERNARD FARRELL stage \nplay Tire Last Apaclte Re1111io11 which continues at the \nBell,table until Saturday 4 March. Details on (061) \n319866) \n-•· . .. '",

From the five song s on the tape one cannot \nbut get the impression that they take them selves very \nseriously. Hailing from in and around the city ,the \nH erm have been on the go for a year or so now gigging \naround various hostelries. \nI mu st concede that I was very excited listening to the \nopen ing bars of the first song. Okay so the four chords \nit's based around have been done to death but for m e \nit was the voca ls w hich enthralled, managing to get \nuncannily close to \"slow ly goes the night\" era of Nick \nCave .Unfortunately , the said vocalist soon decided \nthat rather than sounding like Australia's greatest \nCabaret singer, he'd like to emulate the 'least articu­\nlate man to scream in.to a Shure SM5 8' -yes I am talking \nabout Eddie Vedder . Despite relatively goo d sound \nquality(especially in the context of dem o tapes) ,on \nsome tracks it was impossible to work out the lyrics. \nThat said,when they were coherent,they seemed \nsomewhat disjointed and perhaps relying too much \non the usual rock cliches : \"Darkest dreams , deepest \nfears\"etc. The instrumentation is top notch with good \nbalance between th~ musicians and this alone.should \nhold them in good stead. Herm show considerable \npromise but they really ought to lighten up.

Dragging our F amily sized tent with us, \nwe em erged into the bright sunlight ( that \nwas to continue for the wh ole o f the next \nthree days) and proceeded directly to .... the \nnear est pub.A few hours later , we em erged \nfrom there, back into t he the cool even ing \na ir , and proceeded to the campsite by bus. \n__ We~l , what we thought was the c amp site.

Being ace L .E .G jour­\nnalists we naturally headed b ack stage. The \ncrowd there consisted of 99% of people like \nus, looking around for s omeb ody famous . Unf or-\ntunately the mi nute we s a t down we were \ninterview ed by Pat o 'Mah ony who seeme d t o be \ncaught under the mis taken imp ression that we \nwere the James Ta y lor Quartet. Odd tha t, see­\ning as how there was six of us there. First \ntruly famous person of the day spotted was \nNICK CAVE clad in luminous yellow shorts, \na Hawaiian shirt with a stuffed Koala bear \nround r.is neck and a surf board under his \narm ....... Well no. Actually he was all in \nblack - including his girlfriend - and he \ntried to bum a quid o ff us to buy a drink. \nHe obviously needed a stiff JD as he was \nabout to join KYLIE on stage for a d uet. A \nthousand prepubescent fantasies flooded \ninto the collective male psyche of the \nstadium as she took to the stage and the \nmoshing at the front during \"Better the \nDevil you Know \" was merely an effort to \nget close to· the navel- revealing, for.mer \ntea-time temptress. Before Kylie,TRICKY \nand co . had rocked the stadium with an \nexcellent set which suffered majorily due \nto it's early time slot. Likewise BLACK \nGRAPE, who provoked the first pogoing of \nthe day w:i:th \"Reverend Black Grape\" .The \nhighlight of the weekend was up next in \nthe shape of 5\"5 ' New Yorker M:>BY who blew all \naway wi th h is brace of Hi-NRG stompers inter­\nspersed wi th a cover of Purple Ha ze and a \nHusk er Du style guitar numb er of his own .After \nthat the PRODIGY served as something of a let­\ndown and with the double interruption o f two \npowercuts. during the set - the second one sig­\nnalling set 's end - it was a bad end to a mid-\ndling day . And just when we thought it \ncouldn't get any worse : When we reached our \ntent we discovered that that large blue mar­\nquee was not a large blue drinking establish-\nment of sorts bu t weekend home of the Hare \nKr ishna 's . So it was we found ourselves sub­\njected t o chan ting until 8 :45 the next morn-\ning. Ha!Ha! But us ten t dwellers go t our \nrevenge on the Hare Krishna's by climbing up \none side o f their tent and sliding down the \nother.And I thought Hare Krishna's were non \nv io lent .........••• \nSaturday night merged into Sunday morning and \neventually a p oint where sleep no longer ma t­\ntered was reached .

And this \nwas just the queue for th e train ti \nup ,Wake up. , .... No , it's not the \nBOO RADLEYS song but the shouting o f the s ta­\ntion ma ster, telling us to get o ff the noon \ntrain . Dragging our F amily sized tent with us, \nwe em erged into the bright sunlight ( that \nwas to continue for the wh ole o f the next \nthree days) and proceeded directly to .... the \nnear est pub.A few hours later , we em erged \nfrom there, back into t he the cool even ing \na ir , and proceeded to the campsite by bus. \n__ We~l , what we thought was the c amp site. It \nwas in fac t at the end of a track about a \nmile long sober and abou t e ight miles long \ndrunk.We set up the tent beside a large \nmarque e (which we naturally assumed was \nkind o f alcohol selling establishment) and \nheaded on for Paire Ui Ca oimh wh ich - a ll the \nway back up the forest track and abou t tw ice \ntha t d istance aga in. Considering there w as \nabou t 20,000 there it didn't take us long to \nfind p eop le w e knew and i t took them an even \nshorter time to tell us we 'd missed ASH,PWEI \nand GRASSHOPPER - the very bands we 'd come \ndown on Friday to see . Being ace L .E .G jour­\nnalists we naturally headed b ack stage. The \ncrowd there consisted of 99% of people like \nus, looking around for s omeb ody famous . Unf or-\ntunately the mi nute we s a t down we were \ninterview ed by Pat o 'Mah ony who seeme d t o be \ncaught under the mis taken imp ression that we \nwere the James Ta y lor Quartet. Odd tha t, see­\ning as how there was six of us there. First \ntruly famous person of the day spotted was \nNICK CAVE clad in luminous yellow shorts, \na Hawaiian shirt with a stuffed Koala bear \nround r.is neck and a surf board under his \narm ....... Well no. Actually he was all in \nblack - including his girlfriend - and he \ntried to bum a quid o ff us to buy a drink. \nHe obviously needed a stiff JD as he was \nabout to join KYLIE on stage for a d uet. A \nthousand prepubescent fantasies flooded \ninto the collective male psyche of the \nstadium as she took to the stage and the \nmoshing at the front during \"Better the \nDevil you Know \" was merely an effort to \nget close to· the navel- revealing, for.mer \ntea-time temptress. Before Kylie,TRICKY \nand co . had rocked the stadium with an \nexcellent set which suffered majorily due \nto it's early time slot. Likewise BLACK \nGRAPE, who provoked the first pogoing of \nthe day w:i:th \"Reverend Black Grape\" .The \nhighlight of the weekend was up next in \nthe shape of 5\"5 ' New Yorker M:>BY who blew all \naway wi th h is brace of Hi-NRG stompers inter­\nspersed wi th a cover of Purple Ha ze and a \nHusk er Du style guitar numb er of his own .After \nthat the PRODIGY served as something of a let­\ndown and with the double interruption o f two \npowercuts. during the set - the second one sig­\nnalling set 's end - it was a bad end to a mid-\ndling day . And just when we thought it \ncouldn't get any worse : When we reached our \ntent we discovered that that large blue mar­\nquee was not a large blue drinking establish-\nment of sorts bu t weekend home of the Hare \nKr ishna 's . So it was we found ourselves sub­\njected t o chan ting until 8 :45 the next morn-\ning. Ha!Ha! But us ten t dwellers go t our \nrevenge on the Hare Krishna's by climbing up \none side o f their tent and sliding down the \nother.And I thought Hare Krishna's were non \nv io lent .........••• \nSaturday night merged into Sunday morning and \neventually a p oint where sleep no longer ma t­\ntered was reached .

Th ey we re i n stark \n~on~rast to the mod pop of MENSWEAR , looking \ndist~nctly uncomf ortable in their three piece \nsuits and becom ing distinctly boring o nce \nthey'd p layed their single.GALLIANO wer e just \nright for the weather and mana ged to win a \nfew indie kids over to their blissed-out -\njazz mer ging with dope beats.The bare chested \nTERENCE TRENT n 'ARB Y proved he was not fish \nbut flesh and sent many 's a female and the \nodd male pulse a racing. \nFurhter delight cam in the sound o f \"Line up \" \nand in the form of Donna , the bass player wh o \nmad e ELASTICA 's set one of the best o f \nthe day.

And this \nwas just the queue for th e train ti \nup ,Wake up. , .... No , it's not the \nBOO RADLEYS song but the shouting o f the s ta­\ntion ma ster, telling us to get o ff the noon \ntrain . Dragging our F amily sized tent with us, \nwe em erged into the bright sunlight ( that \nwas to continue for the wh ole o f the next \nthree days) and proceeded directly to .... the \nnear est pub.A few hours later , we em erged \nfrom there, back into t he the cool even ing \na ir , and proceeded to the campsite by bus. \n__ We~l , what we thought was the c amp site. It \nwas in fac t at the end of a track about a \nmile long sober and abou t e ight miles long \ndrunk.We set up the tent beside a large \nmarque e (which we naturally assumed was \nkind o f alcohol selling establishment) and \nheaded on for Paire Ui Ca oimh wh ich - a ll the \nway back up the forest track and abou t tw ice \ntha t d istance aga in. Considering there w as \nabou t 20,000 there it didn't take us long to \nfind p eop le w e knew and i t took them an even \nshorter time to tell us we 'd missed ASH,PWEI \nand GRASSHOPPER - the very bands we 'd come \ndown on Friday to see . Being ace L .E .G jour­\nnalists we naturally headed b ack stage. The \ncrowd there consisted of 99% of people like \nus, looking around for s omeb ody famous . Unf or-\ntunately the mi nute we s a t down we were \ninterview ed by Pat o 'Mah ony who seeme d t o be \ncaught under the mis taken imp ression that we \nwere the James Ta y lor Quartet. Odd tha t, see­\ning as how there was six of us there. First \ntruly famous person of the day spotted was \nNICK CAVE clad in luminous yellow shorts, \na Hawaiian shirt with a stuffed Koala bear \nround r.is neck and a surf board under his \narm ....... Well no. Actually he was all in \nblack - including his girlfriend - and he \ntried to bum a quid o ff us to buy a drink. \nHe obviously needed a stiff JD as he was \nabout to join KYLIE on stage for a d uet. A \nthousand prepubescent fantasies flooded \ninto the collective male psyche of the \nstadium as she took to the stage and the \nmoshing at the front during \"Better the \nDevil you Know \" was merely an effort to \nget close to· the navel- revealing, for.mer \ntea-time temptress. Before Kylie,TRICKY \nand co . had rocked the stadium with an \nexcellent set which suffered majorily due \nto it's early time slot. Likewise BLACK \nGRAPE, who provoked the first pogoing of \nthe day w:i:th \"Reverend Black Grape\" .The \nhighlight of the weekend was up next in \nthe shape of 5\"5 ' New Yorker M:>BY who blew all \naway wi th h is brace of Hi-NRG stompers inter­\nspersed wi th a cover of Purple Ha ze and a \nHusk er Du style guitar numb er of his own .After \nthat the PRODIGY served as something of a let­\ndown and with the double interruption o f two \npowercuts. during the set - the second one sig­\nnalling set 's end - it was a bad end to a mid-\ndling day . And just when we thought it \ncouldn't get any worse : When we reached our \ntent we discovered that that large blue mar­\nquee was not a large blue drinking establish-\nment of sorts bu t weekend home of the Hare \nKr ishna 's . So it was we found ourselves sub­\njected t o chan ting until 8 :45 the next morn-\ning. Ha!Ha! But us ten t dwellers go t our \nrevenge on the Hare Krishna's by climbing up \none side o f their tent and sliding down the \nother.And I thought Hare Krishna's were non \nv io lent .........••• \nSaturday night merged into Sunday morning and \neventually a p oint where sleep no longer ma t­\ntered was reached . We made it to the s tadium \nH mmm .... Kylle's \nnavel. \nLoui se 's nipples, \nDamon ·s sweat \nstain s. \nPaul 's pout ...... \nWHERE ARE T HE \nPICT URES O F \nT E RE N CE 'S \nCHEST??! \nLIFE \nthey played all their hits - and even in \nsp ite of their delectable new singer -they \nwer e o nly the wa rm up bout to the main fight \nthat wa s BLUR .They had an aw ful lo t to live \nup t o did BLUR and while there w as nothing \nparticularly ,wr ong with the performan ce, \nit's just that it seemed a bit .... \nwell ... dead, Parklife w ithout Phil Dani els \nwa s a let down and the new material just \ndidn't seem to go down all that well. Fun and \nall, bu t it could have been a w hole lot \nbetter . \nDespite fevered attempts,we managed to miss \nSCHTUM and instead had to sit through the \nDEVLINS and REVELIID before stay ing ou t for \nthe Monkeetastic bu t none the less appropri­\nately mo nikered DODGY . Th ey we re i n stark \n~on~rast to the mod pop of MENSWEAR , looking \ndist~nctly uncomf ortable in their three piece \nsuits and becom ing distinctly boring o nce \nthey'd p layed their single.GALLIANO wer e just \nright for the weather and mana ged to win a \nfew indie kids over to their blissed-out -\njazz mer ging with dope beats.The bare chested \nTERENCE TRENT n 'ARB Y proved he was not fish \nbut flesh and sent many 's a female and the \nodd male pulse a racing. \nFurhter delight cam in the sound o f \"Line up \" \nand in the form of Donna , the bass player wh o \nmad e ELASTICA 's set one of the best o f \nthe day.
