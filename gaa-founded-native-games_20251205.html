The part where the bow! lands first is called the\n“play,” and if a bowl is placed accurately and with good\nstrength, a good throw is the usual result. Some first-class men\ncan strike the little tuft of grass sixty yards away that their\nadvisers put down for their guidance. This will give some idea\nof the perfection to which the pastime has been brought.\nAll players swing the arm completely around after a run\nof eight or ten yards, and much depends on the method\nwhich a player has acquired in performing this run up",

Again and again in his big “ scores” he smiled with honest confidence in the face of the mighty handicap of two bowls odds half-way through, and it was often m the last throw that he landed “the goods” for his adoring backers. His matches are well remembered by all followers of the game south of the Blackwater. “Buck,” too, has found his way to and con- tinues his fame in, Yankee land. When McGrath was in his prime he met with an unexpected defeat in a big score with a fine cut of a young bowler—Jim Barrett, of the south side. Barrett stood six feet one, and was an Adonis in mould. He was cool, canny, strong, and just the man to lower McGrath's colours. Barrett continued to win everywhere after McGrath left Ireland, and landed no less than twelve successive “big” scores inside a few years. Then came fhe one and only Paddy Murphy, of Waterloo, a young giant of six feet three in his stockinged feet, with a style that combined ease and strength to a wonderful degree, and with a loft that only Driscoll in his prime could equal. Though Barrett’s greater experience told in the early matches, Murphy’s shyness gradually wore away, and in the last big “score” played in the Cork liberties he proved himself a real champion on a road that suited him but little. Murphy is still the generally acknowledged bowling champion, and with his privilege of venue (for he will now chose a wide road) he is not likely to be beaten for years. The only likely candidates for championship honours outside the veteran Jim Barrett are the well-known athletes, W. F. Bennett, D. O'Leary, Coppeen, and Jack Driscoll, of Clondrohid.

M'Namara--these various \nclasses of men were amongst those present, and their \nnames indicate the broad and representative basis upon \nwhich the proposed exhibition in July of next year is \nto be carried out. \nMr. T. A. Ferguson proposed \"that an Industrial \nExhibition be held in Limerick, opening the first week \nin July, 1906, to be called 'The Munster and Connacht \nIndustrial Exhibition.\" In supporting this resolution \nMr. James S. Gaffney, Solr., in the course of his re­\nmarks as reported in the ~/Jfunster 1Yews, said:-\" It was \na great pity that they, Limerick people, and Irish \npeople as a whole, especially in the South of Ireland, \nshould not rely sufficiently on themselves, and show that \nreliance by buying where they could goods made in Ire­\nland that were as good and cheap as goods made else­\nwhere (hear, hear). He_ had 3:dopted the practice in his \nown household of buymg Irish-manufactured goods. \nThe crux was, would things be got as good and as cheap \nin Ireland as elsewhere, and in that relation he had seen \na most interesting corresp01idence in a newspaper with \nsome of the views of which many people did not agree­\nhe meant the Dublin LEADER, which had done au enor­\nmous amount of good for the manufacturers of Ireland \n(hear, bear)-a correspondence a~ to _whether people \nshould buy Irish goods even at prices higher than those \npaid for the foreign goods, and he saw that the vas~ ma­\njority, of the manufacturers of Ireland were unammous \nin saying that they did not want any patronage on t~e \ngrouud that they were Irish mauufactul'Crs-they chcl \nnot want anybody to buy goods from them excep~ they \nwere as good and as cheap as goods manufactured many \npart of the world (hear, hear). If they put that forward \nin supporting this Exhibition, it would be a success.\" \nA Committee consisting of the E ,xecutive of the Lime­\nrick Industrial Association and the following-with \npower to adcl to their numbers--were appointed to carry \nout the arrangements for the. Munster and Connacht \nExhibition of 1906 :-Sir Thomas Cleave, Messrs. J. E. \nGoodbody, Archibald Murray, James Quin, Samu 'el Lee, \nWilliam Lloyd, David Tidmarsh, John Egan, A. Bar­\nnett, W. L. Stokes, P. E. Bourke together with the \nManagers of the five Banks in the city. \nThere was a \" Grand Christy Minstrel \" entertain­\nment and· concert at St. lVfary's Temperance Hall, Irish­\ntown, Glomnel. A programme of the great event is \nbefore us. The strenuous, manly and self-respecting \nmajority at a recent meeting of the Executive of the \nGaelic League in Dublin should look after the Olonmel \nniggers. 1'hey had no Irish vocal items, nay,, even \nmore, they had no Anglo-Irish vocal item at their enter­\ntainment at St. Mary's Temperance Hall, Irishtown, \nOlonmel, and yet no \"unauthorised persons\" even \n·\" held up\" Bones I • One of the niggers sang \"Looking \nfor a Coon like me.\" vVho was looking for him 7 As \nwe are persons \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" perhaps \nwe have no right to intrude our enquiries into such mat­\nters. Why should we ask questions of Coons if we may \nnot ask a question of the Central Body of the Gaelic \nLeague? There are possibly \" unauthorised \" Coons \nas well as \" unauthorised\" Gaelic L~aguers I And if the \nGaelic League authorities are above criticism, why \nshould not the Coons, also, be exempt 7 Very Rev. \nCanon Flavin, P .P., au Irish speaker, is Director of the \nT em perance Sodality, but Canon Flavin is not respon­\nsible for this un-Irisb programme. We are informed \nthat Canon Flavin, with his own money acquired two \nhouses (one of them a drunkery, the licence of which he \nextinguished). These two houses he reconstructed, ex­\ntended, furnished, fitted and converted into a Tem ­\nperance Hall for the benefit of his parishioners. The \nworking tnen themselves were given a free band in mak­\ning out the programme of their first concert, and the· \ninnane and unnational thing that we have been refer­\ning to was the result. More than one member of the \nCommittee attempted to hav.e national songs introduced, \nbut to no purpose. The performers, all, we understand, \n\"patriots \" of the greenest type, were more concerned \nabout showing off their powers as vocalists in nigger and \nEnglish lyrics than singing even Anglo-Irish songs like \n\"The Wearing o' the Green,\" \"Who fears to speak of \n'98,\" or even Moore's melodies. But as persons \"ob­\nnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" what business is it of ours? \nSome members of the Executive of the Gaelic League \nshould look aHer these niggers of Clonmel. \nWe have received a report of the annual meeting of \nthe Duhallow C'oisde C'eanntair which was held recently \na,t Boherbee. Father P'. O'Regan, C.O., Vice-President, \nwas in the chair. The Secretary's report was as \nfollows :-The C'oiscle was established at a meeting held \nin Kanturk, on March 25th, 190-4, and bas been, there­\nfore, something more than twelve months in existence. \nDuring that time eight meetings have been held and \ntwenty-five resolutions passed, and this represents the \nsum total of the work .of your body. When the Coi~de \nwas established all the six branches of which it consists \nwere conducting Irish classes; but owing to the want of \na competent teacher among their members, no classes \nwere conducted in two of these branches during last \nsession. It will, therefore, be seen that the language \nis in a worse condition in Duhallow at present than it \nwas twelve months ago. vVere it not for the a.ction, or \nrather inaction, of your Coiscle and of the Coiscle \nGnotlw, these two branches would probably have \nmanaged to have classes somehow. As early \nas M'ay last, the question of appointing a \ntravelling teacher for the Coisde C'ecmntair area was \nunder consideration, but was postponed to \nOctober. vVlien the matter was brought on again at \ntlie October meeting, the majority of the delegates re­\nfused to take any action-on it, and would not even ask \nthe C'oiscle Gnotlui for a subsidy towards paying a teacher \nfor the branches that had none. The Secretary of one \nof the branches affected, seeing that no help was to be \nexpected from yom body, explained to the Goisde Gnotha \nthat his branch would fall through unless they got \nsome aid from the Central body to help them to pay \nthe salary of a teacher.

We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G.

In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know .

Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses.

If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding .

S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

In their struggle to win the county preliminaries Thurles defeated Two-Mile- Borris at Holycross. Then, as now, Borris was a great team. The match was very exciting, and was well contested. The next game was played at what was known as the “Store Jug Field,” Thurles, from which Borrisoleigh retired defeated. At the third of the County matches the pick of North Tipperary lined out against Thurles at Borrisoleigh. After a rattling good game Thurles won the County final. At Nenagh, Clare was defeated by 1 goal 7 points to 2 points, and the first Mun- ster Championship was Tipperary’s. The Leinster representa- tives, Kilkenny, were next vanquished—the following being from a contemporary réport of the match :—“ The Inter-County Hurling tie between Kilkenny and Tipperary was played off to-day, Thursday, at Urlingford. Thurles represented Tip- perary, and Urlingford Kilkenny. The weather in the morning showed very bad, as heavy showers fell. Before noon the rain, however, ceased, and during the time of play not a drop descended. Precisely at two o'clock the play commenced, and in the first five minutes Thurles placed a goal to its credit. At the end of full time the following extraordinary result was announced:—For Thurles, 4 goals 6 points, and one forfeit point to nil for Tullaroan. A large crowd of people was on the field, and the order maintained was excellent.” The All-Ire- land final was played at Birr on Easter Sunday, March, 1888. The rival team was Galway, and after a game largely in Gal- way’s favour, Thurles, by desperate and characteristic play in the concluding minutes, retrieved their fortunes, and won by a goal scored in the last second almost.",

The\nnext game was played at what was known as the “Store Jug\nField,” Thurles, from which Borrisoleigh retired defeated. At\nthe third of the County matches the pick of North Tipperary\nlined out against Thurles at Borrisoleigh. After a rattling\ngood game Thurles won the County final.
