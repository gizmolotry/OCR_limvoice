It was featured. by harmony at our Council\nmeetings, an unbroken record of manly discipline upon our play-\ning fields, victory in one of the two great All-Ireland finals and\nin one of the Inter-Provincials, a record number of affiliated clubs\nin the province, whilst on the financial side we were able at the\nend of the year to allocate the considerable surplus of £1,250 to\nthe building up of the Association in the provinces, and as a\npleasant sequel to some recent negotiations we hope to see con-\ncluded here to-day what was an unfortunate episode in the his-\ntory of the Colleges’ Association. Each of these headings is a\nremarkable achievement in itself and something to be proud of,\nbut greatest amongst them, to my mind, is that which deals with\nthe discipline of our players. In that respect, the year 1943\nstands as a headline and an inspiration for the years to come. In\nthe eleven matches played for the Munster Championships, there\nwas not a single unworthy incident and when we remember that\nthey generated a crescendo of excitement culminating in the\nclimax of the finals, with players strained to the utmost in the\nmajority of the matches—a point or two being the margin in many\ncases—we are forced to pay tribute to the gallant manliness of\nour Munster Gaels, and may their successors emulate their splen-\ndid example,",

[ w ou ld therefore suggest that the Coun ty Councils should be \nentrusted with the custody of the very numer0us remains with which the country \nis studded, embracing earthworks, pillar-stones, cromlechs, and such other \nobjects as would necessitate little or no expenditure of money, which would \nonly require to be left alone and preserved from the destruction with which \nsuch objects are daily threatened, and where irreparable injury could be done in \na few days and before any central authority at a distance could intervene. Tbe \nmere fact of their being vested in a local body, and under local supervision, would \nact as a deterrent, while the occupiers and farm labourers would be \nimpressed with their importance, instead of regarding them as incumbrances to be \ncleared off the ground as quickly as possible. This wou ld quite get over \nthe whole difficulty and objection on the score of expense, and if this plan were \nbrought before the different County Councils judiciously, there is no doubt they \nwould readily fall in with the arrangement, and counties already disposed \nto spend n1oney could still continue to take over structures involving expenditure \nif they so desirtd. It would then ren1ain for the Government to continue to take \nover structures requiring some expenditure on their initial repair and subsequent \npreservation. * * * * * * * * * * The structures I refer to as \nbeing considered of National importance would be the tnonastic buildings, larger \nchurches, round towers, som e of the high crosses, and Ogham stones, the n1ore \nimpor tant castles and fortified houses.\" \nThe classification and recording of monun1ents is a matter of some \nurgency, as at present the reservation of any monument by the Estates \nCommisioners depends very much on whether the landlord's solicitor",

This ,vould especially apply to some portions \nof the district under notice. The author of the notes on the Cromleac \nhas had a long correspondence with Rev.

'l'o construct these, it ,vas necessary to \nremove ~he existing south wall of the choir. The new wall supports the \nvaulting, and in it, the credence and piscina, described by the Rev.

'fhe roots of ivy have gro,vn up \nbehveen these w~lls now, and forced them about three inches apart, an·d \n,vill ultimately throw down one, or both walls.

A window, as illustrated, ,vas introduced \nto light the ne,v east end of the church ; the problems the Rev. Mr. \nS_eymour found it difficult to unravel, in connection with this east end, \n.are technical ones, caused by this window cutting through the existing \nchancel arch. vVindows in this style were common in 'England in the \nfourteenth century; and it is to this period we should assign these altera­\ntions. Th~ present west end of church, with window, was built at the \nsame time. At this time the revenue of Liathmore belonged to the \nTreasurer of Cashel Cathedral, and the d·uties were probably perforn1ed \nby a vicar, for whon1 a residence \\vas-provided. This vaulting of the \nchoir, and sometim~~ of the choir and sanctuary, with a residence over \nfor the priest, is met with in Norman churches in England, and. also in \n,churches of the fourteenth century ( r 1 ).

Probably the superstition was preserved by some of the \ncastle builders, who 1nade use of those from the ruined churches, or had \nnew ones carved for the same purpose. The tr~atment of this figure, \nand its adoption as a decorative feature in this position is unique. \nT,vo of the stones on the imposts on the north side of the chancel arch, \nhave carving in lo,v relief which I consider worth reproducing. 'fhe \ncentre stone, and the stones forming the in1post on the south side of the \narch are plain undressed stones. The impos t measures 3 feet 7 inches \nacross.

Fron, the ground it is very difficult to say what the design is, \nparticularly on the western stone, whiclz z's built't'n upside down, so that \nthe animal (which is very clear in the illustration) is difficult to under-, \nstand. After a rubbing has been taken, and developed, the design \nbe~omes clear. That these carved stones were not designed for this \nposition is clear, first from the fact of the ani1nal being set in on its back, \nand that one stone has the carving inside a margin, whil~ the other has \nnot, and the spirit of the ornament in each is different.

The fact that this \ncarving was treated as debris and used as rough stone in forming this \nchancel arch-which is built of sandstone and probably of the twelfth \ncentury- is an argument against advancing it into that period, even \nthat the ornament was characteristic of it, which it is not.

The most obvious rules of induction, then, point to the conclusiqr:i, \nthat these are the remains of buildings of Anglo Saxon date.\" The \nargument might be carried further in the case of Irish architecture, by \nconsidering the superiority of the Irish sculptors of the tenth century,. \nto the Anglo-Saxons which ,vould naturally affect the details of Irish, \nchurch architecture,, so that ,vith a direct inspiration from Gaul, th_e· \nstyle known as Norman, would develop here earlier and more rapidly· \nthan in England, ,vbere it was derived from the sa1ne source. \nTh e two figures carved on the san1e stone before referred to may be· \nseen in the view· of the south door, built in over the arch between two .. \ncarved heads.

Other items, perhaps, might be mentioned, too;\nbut in what we have said we have included the main\ndepartments in the code. There are various kinds of\nkicks as we have hinted all along—the punt, the drop,\nthe screw, the fly-kick, the place-kick, and the kicking\nof a running ball. Punting the ball is the most usual\nmethod of kicking, and it may be no harm for the\nbenefit of younger players to state that the most effec-\ntive method of punting a ball is to kick it with the in-\nstep instead of the toes. How to kick the ball in the\nother ways enumerated must be acquired on the field\nfrom a competent player. In this, as in every other\nart, there is no royal road, and the services of a teacher\nhave to be called upon. Indeed, the simplest way to\nlearn good football is to play it with competent players,\nand if it happens that there is a tradition of clean foot-\nball in a particular district, young players will have little\nor no difficulty, if they have the adaptability and enthus-\niasm, to pick up the game. ; ;\n| Bins fe saying that all kinds of practice\nmatches should be useful for the purpose in hand.

It is really not altogether fair\nto the players themselves to be forced to go\ninto special training for some weeks. The ma-\njority of our Gaelic men cannot afford the time\nor the expense to do so. Likewise, it is rather hard\non the public, who are called upon to give special\nsubscriptions to defray the heavy expenses of the players\non such occasions. Secondly, there is the danger of\nsome of the players being trained ‘‘too fine.’’ This\nmay happen especially in case of the younger members\nof the selected team, and perhaps, too, in regard to\nplayers who, as we have already said, lead an outdoor\nlife and work hard. Of course, experienced trainers\nwill take care that such a thing will not happen. We\nhave had the good fortune in the Kingdom of having\nthe volunteer services of Messrs.

But that's another column. So ..... . \nAFFIE YUSSUF is a man hovering in the space \nbetween the techno soul of Chicago and the techno \nexperimentation of Europe . He deals in deepness, and \non his newie 'SAUCER SHAPED OBJECTS', the name of \nBOO WILLIAMS springs instantly to mind. This is a • \nrecord which will appeal to some house fans and some \ntechno heads but probably not to all of any genre. Not \nthat there's anything sub-standard about the release : \nIt is, in fact, quite excellent. \nIn the early '80s that merry band NEW ORDER took \noff to the good old U.S.of A. where they teamed up \nwith ARTHUR BAKER . They returned with a \nblueprint for music which is still relevant today. 'BLUE \nMONDAY ' went on to become the best selling 12\" of \nan age and now - IO years later -has proven to be as \ntruly ahead of its time as SLY or MARVINs best mate­\nrial was in their own heyday. But now it's '95 and \nHARD FLOOR (who else) have emerged with their \ninterpretation. The German duo keep the vocal and \nbasic song structure while inserting the obligatory big \nbreakdown and adding a mind-blowing acidic under­\ncurrent. 1AM & SPOON contribute a nu-energy -ish \nversion, not quite up to the standard of \ni \nHARDFLOORs mix, but amaze w ith an incredible I \nambient dub (yes - ambient dub) . And w ith the still \nfresh-sounding original included it all adds up to a \npackage of distinction. \nFlying out of BLACKSPOT this past week has been \nST . GERMAINs 'BOULEVARD '. Hailing from the same-\nnamed Parisian suburb, ST . GERMAIN is the brain­\nchild of one LUDOVIC NAVARRE . NAVARRE has, in \nthe past, bee responsible for deep techno records \nunder the name of MODUS VIVENDI and DEEPSIDE, \nbut it was on the release of the 'BOULEVARD 'series of \n3 E.Ps (collected here on a double album) that his \nn~me really shot into the spotlight. 'BOULEVARD' is \nnot techno. It is beautiful natural music. It is House, it \nis dub reggae, it is soul and hip hop and it is most defi­\nnitely jazz. The tunes (played by real musicians) are \nfrom Paris via New York but never lose their originali­\nty. A track-by-track listing is not really required and \nwould be pointless. Suffice to say that if you enjoy \ndeep MASTERS-type house music, you probably won't \nfind a more accomplished record as this all year. \nElsewhere 'HOOKED' by 99th FLOOR ELEVATORS \nfeatures a TONY DE VITmix (he of TRADE) and not \nmuch else really.

          "raw_text": "Thursday August 17th -Wednesday August 30th• LI I ERIC IC EV EN TS Ii U IDE \nASH \n'Girl From Mars' \nFor this their new single ASH have taken a sharp turn \nfrom the coy reminiscing that made the recently \nreleased UNCLE PAT such a hit.The martial arts refer­\nences of KUNG FU have been abandoned in favour of \nplanetary references which convey the far out nature \nof Tim Wheelers lost love.The song opens w ith yo ung \nTim 's strained voice lamenting the girl wh o never \nknew of his love for her,before crashing into the usual \nmael strom of distorted guitar ,heaving bass and disap­\npointing ly lightweight drums .Produced by form er \nCure bass player Phil Th omally,it successfully vari­\nates on a so far winning formul a and even includes a \npiano overdub.Let's hop e Tim gets his by now infa­\nm o us A Levels and doesn't have to spend another \nyea r giving the teachers notes asking them to leave \nhim off his home w ork because he's go ing on tour w ith \nElastica.A sure fire hit. \nTHE HERM \n'DEMO TAPE' \nWith the current crop of yo un ger band s such as \nSUPERGRASS et al wanting nothing m ore than to \nfeel \"Alright\", I must admit a certain am ount of baf­\nflement at the emergence of band s such as THE \nHERM . From the five song s on the tape one cannot \nbut get the impression that they take them selves very \nseriously. Hailing from in and around the city ,the \nH erm have been on the go for a year or so now gigging \naround various hostelries. \nI mu st concede that I was very excited listening to the \nopen ing bars of the first song. Okay so the four chords \nit's based around have been done to death but for m e \nit was the voca ls w hich enthralled, managing to get \nuncannily close to \"slow ly goes the night\" era of Nick \nCave .Unfortunately , the said vocalist soon decided \nthat rather than sounding like Australia's greatest \nCabaret singer, he'd like to emulate the 'least articu­\nlate man to scream in.to a Shure SM5 8' -yes I am talking \nabout Eddie Vedder . Despite relatively goo d sound \nquality(especially in the context of dem o tapes) ,on \nsome tracks it was impossible to work out the lyrics. \nThat said,when they were coherent,they seemed \nsomewhat disjointed and perhaps relying too much \non the usual rock cliches : \"Darkest dreams , deepest \nfears\"etc. The instrumentation is top notch with good \nbalance between th~ musicians and this alone.should \nhold them in good stead. Herm show considerable \npromise but they really ought to lighten up.

CLARE. \nBY THOMAS JOHNSON WESTROPP, M.A., M.R.I.A. \nWe have in this Journal for several years endeavoured to point out \nthe antiquities which add an interest to the various health resorts along \nthe Clare coast. Having (so far as we were able) dealt with the remains \naccessible from :Miltown Malbay and Liscloonvarna, we naturally turn to \nthe district between them, round Lehinch. The individuality of this place \nis very marked. The irregular breakers of Miltown and Kilkee are re­\nplaced by the beautifully regular crescents of waves marching up the \nlong shallow bay of Liscannor with well marked cro5s waves deflected \nfrom each shore, travelling towards each other without deranging the \ncurved ridges on their way shoreward. The high walls of cliffs at Kil­\nkee and the low reefs of Miltown have here no equivalent. Low shale \ncliffs occur and high sand dunes, behind which a winding creek with \n.low marshy fields runs clown from Kilshanny, past where Cairn Con­\nnaughtagh hides its secret among the swamps, to the ta11, grey ghost of \nDough Castle. The creek, here a mass of rippled silver, is often full of \nopalescent jelly fish, shining with gold and purple in the sun. It, with \nthe bay, helps to form the peninsula Leath innsi, or Lebinsi, which gave \nthe village and angle its correct name. This was at first anglicised as \n\"I.ehinch.\" At present, even this less barbarous form is getting \nswallowed up by the abominable \"Lahinch\" (the yet more hurrible \n\"Lahenzey,\" used Ly Archdeacon Kenny, is fortunately, extinct). The \nother, promulgated by Lewis-father of fearful spellings-should be, in \nthese days of Irish revival, opposed by all, though the ever increasing \nranks of the golfer and the lovers of the Atlantic coast (unversed in \nname loi:e) are rapidly stereotyping it in its worst form.",

In Ballydeely (a place not far \nfrom the road, but down the Daelach and taking its name from that \nstrean1), we see a large, shapely, grey cairn, rising in the marshy fields. \nIt is 25 feet high and 3.00 feet in circuit. The cairn may have been the \nreputed tomb of Daelach, the Firbolg, fron1 \\Vhom the river and town­\nland ( Ballydeely, Daelach's town) took their name. . If so, the chiefs of \n-the Corea Modruad may have adopted it as their place of inauguration, \nas the l)alcassians did the mound and cairn in Magh Adhair, called \nafter Dae lach's brother. There can be but little doubt as to the cairn \nbeing the \"Carn mic Tail,\" the place of tribal assembly, where the \nCorcomroe tribes awaited the coming of Saints MacCreehy and \nLuchtighern, after the raid of the King of Connaught, about A. D. 570-\n580. A thousand years later, in r 57 3, Donall O'Brien mustered his \nforces at Carn lv!ic Tail to oppose a raid of Teige, son of Conor O'Brien. \n1'he latter, with Torlough O'Brien, marched from Slievenagry, near \nKilfenora, and, leaving Smithstown (Bel atha an ghobhann) on the left, \nmarched to Kilmanaheen, and they 1net the enemy at Beal an chip, two \nmiles south from Lehinch. (19) The cairn would tally well w ith the \nsite of \"Carn Mic Tail,\" as Teige in pursuit of Donall 1nust have kept \ndown the river valley to the north of Smithsto,vn, past Kilshanny and \nthe cairn, over the ridge to l(ilmanaheen, and so on to the ford at \nLehinch, called the river Farset in the Elizabethan map s. The ancient \nnarue of the cairn is lost, but the present one is very remarkable. \nLt'gtnd, in 1839, told how in it was entombed a Connaught army, \nwhich, except three chiefs, was exterminated by the n1en of Corcomroe. \nAnother story, however, told how the Connacians pursued and sle\\V a \nmonstrous serpent, ,vhir.h they buried under the cairn.

How forcibly the latter is \nbrought home to us in reading that fascinating paper by Miss Helen \nLaird in the last number of our Journal. (1) From that paper we \ncan learn too that the Gael was a close lover of nature. The description \nof the hermit in his forest abode, rightly thinking it more beautiful than \nthe King's, is a Gaelic idea. Miss Laird gives you Kuno Meyer's \ntranslation of the old Irish poem which I will repeat-\n, Two heath-clad door posts for supports-­\nAnd a lintel of honeysuckle. \nThe bravest band make, music for me \nWho have not been hired. \nIn the eyes of Christ the ever young \nI am no worse off than thou art.' \nShe also shows how truly symbolic the Gaelic names for some flowers \nwere. What more beautiful than that for the Rananculus which clothes \nthe bed of the dried-up stream and was known as 'the brooklet's \nshroud.' That such a delightful study is so much negleded in this \ncountry is much to be deplored. An effort is now being made to \nintroduce the study of Natural History into our schools, and truly it was \ntime to think of sending boys and girls into the world with minds \n(r) \"A Bohareen of Irish Botany.\" Helen Laird.

Whence this colour, and what is its meaning? Are the \npigments the waste of the plants' vigourous life, the ashes of these \nflaming fires which we call flowers? Are the bright petals flags which \nattract bees and other insects to the feasts of honey? Select some \nflowers for careful watching, be a child again, and follow the bee from \nblossom to blossom, realise the marvellous inter-actions between the \nplar.ts and their visitors. Try to think out of the every day life of the \nplant, how the roots suck up water and salts from the soil, how the \nleaves absorb air, how the sunlight shines in upon the living matter of \nthe leaf through a screen of pigment, how light and life in the leaf's \nlaboratory unite their powers, to mingle air and water and salts in subtle \nsecret ways, so that the dead becomes part and parcel of the living. \nAlready the tide has turned, and the flowers are withering and \nfading. The third act bas begun The insects and the breezes have \nfilled their role in carrying the fertilising golden dust from flower to \nflower. In the heart of each new lives are born. The seeds are being \nmade. Whence came they? How are they nurtured ? The feasts of \nhoney are over, the marriage robes of which Ruskin speaks in his \nbeautiful description of the flower (see Fors C/m,igera), are laid aside, it \nis the time of bearing fruit.

Having made our­\nselves acquainted with the haunts of birds, our observations will \nnaturally extend to distinguish between the different species and \nfamilies, in which a referenee to the books will be necessary, and in \nthis way a taste for the study will grow until the coming and the going \nof our birds should prove of more interest to us than the entries for the \nnext Grand National or Derby. It would be interesting for our \neducationists to discover how many in this city out of a population \nof close on 40,000 devote a portion of their time to the study of this or \nany other branch of natural history.

I believe we have \ndouble the number of species of fungi in these islands, that there are \nof flowering plants, so you see the field of labour is extensive, By the \nsea-shore, the members of a Field Club should be busy. The different \nvarieties of beautifully coloured sea-weeds, when dried and mounted, \nform a most interesting collection, which can be identified and described \nfrom any of the works on British sea-weeds, while to the amateur \nConchologist the ' Shells of Ocean ' should form the most attractive \nportion of his colledion. I wonder if any of our members have been \nanticipating me during this season's visit to Kilkee. If not, I hope the \nhint will not be thrown away during the coming summer, and that such \na collection may be seen at our meetings on some future occasion. \n\"I have left Geology for the last because it embraces all the others. \nMany of the Botanical and Zoological specimens that delighted the \n'Field Clubs' of former ages (if such existed) may now be studied in \nthe coal measures or the fossils of the stratification of a roadside quarry. \nThe habitat of some plants too is peculiar to particular rock formations, \nso that the Geologist very often comes to the aid of the Botanist. Thus \nGeology must always form a most important section of a Field Club. \nSuch may be said to be the scope and object of a Naturalists' Field Club. \n\"I have now to refer to the study of History and Archreology, \nsubjects which have been included in our Club programme. Indeed \nit is only through my connection with this section that I claim kindred \nwith you. Your Photographic section is the link that binds us together, \nfor at the present day the photographer is as necessary to the archreo­\nlogist as he is to the naturalist. Indeed I might truly say it is the \nPhotographic section that holds the Club together, for what more \npleasing return can the worker in any section of the Club enjoy than \nthe effective record of his labour by means of the lantern slides of \nthe photographer. \n\"Archreology as studied in the fields, amid the tombs of long­\nforgotten races, or within these ruined shrines, whose history and archi­\ntecture may interest us, has a fascination which grows with our years.",

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

Such in­\nterests as language, law s, m aimers, national ideals.w ere \ninvolved in it. Bu t the inhabitants of the P ale only \nwe re affected ; for, even in the reign of H enry V III., \nt.lie laws ma de by the P arliam ent of the P ale w ere not \ncbeyed twenty miles outside Dublin. Bu t the year \n1537 m arks the beginning of a new epoch in the rela­\ntions between E ngland and Ireland. Th e King claimed \nspiritual as w ell as political supremacy , and the attempt \nto make the Irish substitu te his auU 1ority for the spiri­\ntual supremacy of the P ope brought a new elem ent into \nthe education question. It henceforth became a politico­\nreligious question, and it ha.s remained so to this day . \nTh e object, avowe d or concealed, of every system of \neducation w hich has been devised for the Irish people \neven since has been the Ang licisation of their counti·y. \n• The introduction of the religious eleme nt has not \nchanged the ultimate p urpose. It has been sought to \nP rotestantise them, not so mu ch to save their souls, as \nto A nglicise them . T he spiritual authority assumed \nbY, He nry ~yas w rapped up in his royal authority, as the \nlesser -is\",con.tained in the greater, or as the mea ns is \ndirected to the end . H o:,vever the name may be dis­\nowne d, it is not easy to see how a religion can be na­\ntionalised w ithout being E rastian . Ha d the attempt s \nto P rotestantise the Irish Catholics been w holly or \nma inly successful, Ireland should no longer be a nation, \nbut a province, . w ith no . mo re national individuality \nthan York shire. The Irish in using one and the sam e \nwo rcl., s ,,r,\\11,,(', to express Protestant and En glishman, \ninterpret the philosophy of their history more truly and \nthoroughly than m ost of them have thought . \nIf w e except wha tever education Irish Ca tholics ac­\nquired by stealth, from tha.t time to 1782 the stern alter­\nnative for them w as, their faith without education, or \neducation w ithout their faith. An Act passed in 1665, \nduring the reign of Charles II., fixed that alternative \nby law ; and more stringently still, an Act passed iu \n1 696 during the reign of \\V illiam III., and another \npassed in 1703 under Queen Anne. During all the \nI.8th century the law did not suppose a C atholic to re­\nceive au education, siuce, as w as declared officia.lly from \ntho bench by au Irish judge in 1758, the \"law did not \nsuppose a Papist to exist in the Kingdom , nor could \nthey breathe without _the connivance of government.'' \nCatholic education became possible in 1782, but under \ncertain difficult and dangerous conditions. In 1793 the \nfirst Relief Act came. The clouds of persecution then \nbegan to break, and Ca,tholics were allowed the privilege \nof having their own private schools at their own ex­\npense; they were also permitted to graduate in Trinity \nCollege, but without the privilege of its prizes or emolu­\nments. Since that time several systems of education \nhave been framed for them . But they have not been \nallowed to frame any public system for themselves, and \nthey justly disown all responsibility for eclucational1 \nshortcomings and failures. They rightly say; let those, \nwho have framed those systems which have hitherto been : \ntried, presuming to understand better than ourselves \nwhat system sttits us best, be_ar the discredit of failure \n• I \nl",

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

Maxwell. \nA two 'part video that goes on for over 4 hours in total, Gettysburg is an \naccount of the battle which was the turning point in the American civil war . \nThe Battle of Gettysburg lasted only three days but in that time 50,000 men \nlost their lives. That's more lives lost than were lost by the Americans in Viet­\nnam . \nFilmed on the actual battle site, Gettysburg is a sprawling epic that covers the \nbattle from both sides point of view. Unfortunately it's a bit over zealous in \nattempts to show that no one wanted to be fighting and they all wanted to go \nhome as soon as possible. The costumes are great and the battle scenes are so \nwell filmed but in the category for the most ridiculous false beard Tom \nBerenger's must win an all time award . \nThis film is over patriotic and I would say it will bore the pance off most peo­\nple but having grown up on a diet of John \"The Duke\" Wayne I have a high \ntolerance level for almost any western. I watched Wyatt Earp for God Sake. So \nif you like western era type stuff then you may be able to handle Gettysburg if \nnot, however you may just find that you 'll be wishing yourself of to Fantasia \nmid way through the first part. \nC I N E M A • C I N E \nCONGO \nDylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Tim Curry, Laura Linney, Bruce Campbell. \nDirector: Frank Marshall \nCert: 12 \n\"Indiana Jones meets the Planet Of The Apes \" \nAfter the phenomenal success of Jurassic Park Congo had a lot on it's plate if it \nwanted to surpass it's predecessor, and it looks like that plate was just to fill. \nAfter receiving mysterious transmissions from the heart of the African jungle a· \nteam is sent in to look for survivors and retrieve an experimental laser that will be \nthe future in communications.

          "text": "This week Gillian Chawke, DROP's eye on fashion, takes a \nlook at The Miss Limerick Beauty Contest of 1998 and \nphilosophises on the merits of beauty pageants in general... ... \nBeauty contests, beouty pageants and fashion shows etc. hove all been criti­\ncised over the years, primarily by the fairer of the sex, as being demeaning \nto women, segregating the good from the bod (and the ugly?) and associat­\ning a certain \"Barbie Inspired Mon-made Bubbly Over-rated\" type beauty \nwith the girl in question. Others hove argued that it is what people want \n(mole and female) and that it is just another form of modelling. Either way \nis it the kind of entertainment the 90's women wish to be a port of? \nApparently so judging by the volume of applicants and consequently suc­\ncessful entrants into this year's Miss Limerick Beauty Pageant at the Castle \nLone Tavern, Limerick. Over 35 girls paraded the catwalk in a selection of \nday wear (of the girls choice) and evening wear while 2FM's Lorean Murray \ninquisitioned those \"lucky\" enough to be called bock with ambiguous ques­\ntions and statements which hod the girls giggling incessantly or simply stum­\nbling and stuttering over their well prepared words. Believe me this is a \npersonal recollection, it is a nerve-rocking experience that only the strong \nsurvive. It was emphasised however that all of the judges had spoken at \nlength with each of the entrants and were dose to making a decision before \nthe show hod even begun! Was the finale simply for the public's enjoy­\nment? Well if so they succeeded. \nThe night began on the riverside setting with a beautifully presented buffet \nto tempt palettes and a few \"coups\" of bucks fizz to wash it down . The \nCastle Lane Tavern, Limerick's newest/oldest public house added a wonder­\nful historical magic ambience to the event and was a cosy host to the event. \nIf the interest is anything similar \nto what they achieved this year \nthen next year's organisers \nshould begin securing a larger \nvenue now. \nThere was one entrant however \nwhose intelligent and witty \nremarks stood out amongst the \ncrowd and even had the incorri­\ngible Mr. Murray stuck for \nwords at one point. It was \nNicole Smith, who along with \nher stunning looks complement­\ned by a duck-egg blue/ green \nknit creation by local designer \nMargaret Ryan, was selected \nMiss Limerick 1998 and was repre­\nsenting The Globle /Nestors Bars \nand Restaurants. She will go on to \nrepresent Limerick at the Miss \nIreland competition held in the \nBurlington Hotel, Dublin in late \nAugust and we wish her all the \nluck in the world. \nSo do you hove what it tokes to \nenter a competition based on per­\nsonal appearance and public per­\nception? Do you hove the courage \nto stand up on a stage in front of \nyour piers and sell yourself for who \nyou ore? The real question is do you want or need to in order to convince \nyourself? Does it matter to you what other people perceive you to be? \nAre you comfortable enough with yourself and the way you look, to not \ncore? Well if you ore then no beauty contest in the world will make you \nfeel more beautiful then the radiance that is emitted from someone who is \nhappy and content with their life and themselves. Now that is something \nwe ore all striving to achieve! @ \ntHE ffiAR__~t rriGHtCLUB \nno.6 Robert street Limerick \n,omewhe,e ,ound in a \n,qua,e wo,ld \n23rd.24th.25th.26th july THURS.FRI.SAT.SUN \n11.30 TILL LATE",

          "text": "• Dave Irwin charts the career of the star of Godzilla, Matthew \nBroderick .... \nThe Eighties were strange times for teen-star Matthew \nBroderick. Everyone who was alive in the Eighties remembers \nhis computer hacker genius character in War Games from \n1983. But Broderick didn't hit the big time again until 1986 with \nthe John Hughes' classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In the \nmeantime he had done two small films and Ladyhawke with \nRutger Hauer and Michelle Pfieffer (only her fourth film, Grease \n2 being her first. That is easily the worst sequel of all time. \nCo incidentally, the original Grease is on re-release at the \nmoment and is celebrating its twentieth anniversary. Pfieffer \nherself currently stars in the depressing A thousand Acres with \nJessica Lange. (Can anyone name a film where she doesn't cry? \nBoy that woman can cry. Th ink about it. Rob Roy, Night And The \nCity, Music Box, Cape Fear, Far North, even Tootsie. Major tears \nevery time.Who the hell cries duringTootsie? (and speaking of \nRob Roy, Liam Neeson won 't be taking the role of Frankie in \nAngela's Ashes)). \nProject X {the one about the lab monkey) came in 1987 and \nthe following year Broderick starred in Torch Song Trilogy \n(reprising his stage role in Harvey Fierstein's landmark \nBroadway play) and also in Biloxi Blues (one of three Neil \nSimon autobiographical scripts). \nAnd then came disaster. Some of you may remember the furore \nat the time, when Broderick crashed his car into oncoming traf­\nfic and killed an older woman and her daughter. All this hap­\npened up in Enniskillen. The charge was reduced (undoubtedly \nby those infamous Hollywood lawyers) to dangerous driving and \nhe had merely to pay a fine of £ I 00. Both he and his girlfriend \nat the time, Ferris Bueller co-star Jennifer Grey, had to spend \nmonths in hospital (Grey has done zip careerwise since then \n(ok, ok, so she's done Wind and Bloodhounds Of Broadway, but \ndoes that contradict me?). Th is episode took the wind out of his \nsails and the cheeky-chappie look disappeared for some time. \nHis next venture was the worthy but depressing Glory with \nDenzel Wash ington in 1989. The tragic-comic Family Business \nw ith Dustin Hoffman and Sean Connery came along the same \nyear (a film that also had a depressing ending). In 1990 he could­\nn't resist an offer to co-star in The Freshman w ith Marlon \nBrando (who had just returned from nine years away from \nmovies with the apartheid drama A Dry White Season with \nDonald Sutherland (who 's son Kiefer, by the way, is named after \nWarren Kiefer, the screenwriter on Dona ld's first film Castle Of \nThe Living Dead from 1964)).Three years later he returned to \ncomedy with The Night We Never Met which isn't all that \nbad (but I noticed at the time that, the by then bearded, \n1111ST \nIHCIIYIIY \nBroderick was ham-fistedly air-brushed clean-shaven on the \nposters, possibly (definitely} for pleb-recognition). The next \nyear, 1994, he starred in the film with the year's finest credits \n(Anthony Hopkins, Bridget Fonda, John Cusack, Michael Lerner, \nColm Meaney and directed by (\"our own\") Alan Parker) The \nRoad To Wellville, wh ich ended up as the year's biggest \ncrock of poopie. I know he must have been thinking \"come-\nback\" at this time. He wasn't quite \"whatever-happened-to­\nwhat's-his-name\" yet but he was a bit \"something-must-have­\ngone-wrong-there\". He had part in Mrs. Parker And The \nVicious Circle as the object of affection, but the movie was \ntoo cerebral and too dumb to take off. His next attempt has \nnever been described as \"too cerebral\", The Cable Guy w ith \nJim Carrey, but it has been described as the only miss-step in \nCarrey's phenomenal ascent to stardom. I'm starting to think \nthat Broderick is cursed. But there's a happy ending. He \nworked out some personal stuff by acting, producing and \ndirecting his mother's play Infinity about Nobel Prize winner \nRichard Feynman .And he returned to excellent comic form in \nfellow Eighties man Griffin Dunne's directorial debut \nAddicted To Love with Meg Ryan.A respectable success. \nWh ich brings us up to date. Big lizard movie Godzilla is actu­\nally pretty good. I went to see it with a feeling of dread but \ncame out happy enough. Maybe it's uneven and a bit overlong, \nbut maybe it's good value for money too. Good work Matty. @",

          "text": "Starring: Casper van Dien, Dina Meyer, Michael Ironside \nIt takes balls of steel to spend millions of dollars of somebody else's \nmoney producing a film that so irreverently \nderides what it is supposed to be. But that is \nprecisely what Verhoeven has done in \n\"Starship Troopers\" and done it with such mag· \nnificently malicious enthusiasm that he war· \nrants the eternal gratitude of the entire movie· \ngoing public. For a director whose entire oeu· \nvre was once summed up as lashings of Resh \nand bags of blood, slopping around in a tri­\numph of tastelessness, this latest outing is the perfect riposte. It is all the \naforementioned and more, the sheer joy of it coming from the fact that \nVerhoeven patently knows this and revels in it. This is a vulgar, obnox· \nious, exploitative film, and that's exactly what he intended it to be. The \nscenario is stereotypical sci-fi action fodder, the future of our world \ndependant upon the heroism of a few to protect it from a vile, vicious \nand seemingly • invincible extraterrestrial foe (in this case bugs, \nalbethem the stuff of RentoKill exterminators worst nightmares.) The \ncasting is superb, possessing either an astonishing capacity to sup· \npress even a semblance of ability or else inherently talentless, they are \nso two-dimensional, so ingratiatingly Beverley Hills 90210 plastic with \nattitude, so contemptibly soddish that the earth's destruction seems a \nsmall price to pay for their complete and total annihilation. You simply \ndon't care what happens to them, their shallow superficiality perfectly \nsatirising the oft risible attempts made by films of this kind to generate \n\"real\" characters with \"real\" emotions who \"really\" carry the film. \nToss, absolute and utter. This is SFX heaven, the kids are only in it so \nthe bugs have something to decimate. Verhoeven is nobody's fool and \nimbues \"Starship Troopers\" with the same violent wit that he displayed \nto similar acclaim/outrage in \"Robocop\". He cares not a whit who is \noffended by his vision and seems to temper it simply to get a viewing \ncertificate (This is the man who famously remarked that in his cut of \n\"Basic Instincts\" infamous \"kissing\" scene you know exactly where \nMichael Douglas' tongue is and exactly what it's doing.) Rent and \nrejoice; a sly, studied piss-take and a damn fine spectacle to boot. \n-----reel llash back \nLENNY (18) \nWhat is it? The story of Lenny Bruce, leg-~· \nendary comedian/ social commentator whose ; \ncutting satire lambasting Official America out-~' \nraged the Moral Majority who saw him and his --, , __ \nstyle as borderline sedition. A victim of his own ;. • -, \nnotoriety the film charts the rise of this comic \ngenius and his slide into self-obsessed ranting. \nWho's in it? : Dustin Hoffman \nLAWN DOGS (18) \nDir: John Duigan \nStarring: Kathleen Quinlan, Christopher McDonald, Sam Rockwell, \nMischa Barton. \nIf you watch only one film this month make it \"Lawn Dogs\". From the \ndirector of \"Flirting\" and \"The Year My Voice Broke\" comes one of \nthe most enchanting and touching films I've seen in years. This mag­\nical realist tale of a young girl's burgeoning friendship with \"white \ntrash\" lawn cutter, Trent is one to be enjoyed on a number of levels. \nDirector Duigan demonstrates a simply astonishing control of both \nthe material and his actors, eliciting superbly authentic performances \nfrom all, most particularly from Mischa Barton in what is the best \nperformance from a child actor since Anna Paquin's Oscar-winning \nrole in \"The Piano\". The plot takes a simple fairy tale structure and \nimbues it with a depth and portence which inextricably draws you \ninto the narrative. Bartons sporadic, childlike rendering parallels the \nlarger, contemporary menace of the events that surround and make \nup her life. Cosseted in white-picket fenced suburbia reminisce of Tim \nBurton's \"Edward Scissorhands\" she goes outside the walls in search \nof the uncharted mystery of the forest wherein dwells Trent, her ini· \ntially reluctant confidant and eventual soulmate. At once a biting \ncondemnation of Middle American attitudes and mores and a joy· \nous celebration of of the power of imagination \"Lawn Dogs\" is sim­\nply mesmerising. If, like me, you loved \"Like Water for Chocolate\" \nyou will adore this film. To be cherished. \n---soap barometer--\nGoing Up -Ally McBeal -I know its not exactly \na soap but it is a serial and we all are following \nit. It just so good that it deserves a mention and \nthis is the only place to put it. Ally's mad the \ntwo partners of the firm are eccentric to say the \nlist in fact they all are -one big nutty law firm • \ndoing a great job -even RTE got it before \nChannel four -watch it cos its going to be the \nnext \"Friends\" on our lY screens. \nStaying Afloat· Coronation street • election plots \nwere a bit more exciting and Sally Slapper and \nyer man are heating things up -Maybe Alec \nand Rita will be getting it on soon? Doesn't \nbear thinking about!!! uuhh!! The new barmaid \nis very talented as well!!! \nWhat's so good about it? : Dustin Hoffman who in later years \ndescribed Lenny as simply the best role he'd ever had. \nGoing Down • Home and away -there's some \nkind of psychic on it • strange music plays when \nthe camera focuses on her face (mad? no • just \nplain crap directing). Nearly getting to the \ndepths of Glenroe in its bod days (remember \nMiley thinking about something and a bubble \nbeside his head so we knew what he was think· \ning of!! straight out of Bosco). \nChloe keeps on \nsinking on \nWhat's it like? : Bill Hicks meets \"Raging Bull\" \nWhat's it not like? : An evening with Frank Carson \nhome and away \ndrap32",
