Given a quiet road with a moderately good surface, two young men on the look-out for a healthy and fas- cinating day's pleasure can start away at once. They start from an appointed mark, keeping a look-out for passers-by, and agree to finish at a familiar gate-pillar, at a cross-roads, or at a farmer's house—whatever comes the handiest—say half a mile ahead.

They start the second throw from the end of the first, and so on, the man who gets to the score’s end in the least number of throws winning. Generally, however, a match is made, and there are two partners against two opposing partners. This gives increased zest to the game, as co-operation is essential to success then, and the glorious uncertainty is doubled. Generally there is a small bet on the score, but as score follows score usually with varying success, very little is lost or won, But big stakes are occasionally played for between first-class players, and between champions of different baronies or different towns, and on these occasions the enthusiasm and the excitement of the respective followers know no bounds.

Hard luck in the early part of a contest troubled him not, in fact it only made him put greater heart into his game. Again and again in his big “ scores” he smiled with honest confidence in the face of the mighty handicap of two bowls odds half-way through, and it was often m the last throw that he landed “the goods” for his adoring backers. His matches are well remembered by all followers of the game south of the Blackwater. “Buck,” too, has found his way to and con- tinues his fame in, Yankee land. When McGrath was in his prime he met with an unexpected defeat in a big score with a fine cut of a young bowler—Jim Barrett, of the south side. Barrett stood six feet one, and was an Adonis in mould. He was cool, canny, strong, and just the man to lower McGrath's colours. Barrett continued to win everywhere after McGrath left Ireland, and landed no less than twelve successive “big” scores inside a few years. Then came fhe one and only Paddy Murphy, of Waterloo, a young giant of six feet three in his stockinged feet, with a style that combined ease and strength to a wonderful degree, and with a loft that only Driscoll in his prime could equal. Though Barrett’s greater experience told in the early matches, Murphy’s shyness gradually wore away, and in the last big “score” played in the Cork liberties he proved himself a real champion on a road that suited him but little. Murphy is still the generally acknowledged bowling champion, and with his privilege of venue (for he will now chose a wide road) he is not likely to be beaten for years. The only likely candidates for championship honours outside the veteran Jim Barrett are the well-known athletes, W. F. Bennett, D. O'Leary, Coppeen, and Jack Driscoll, of Clondrohid. All three are first- rate men, and have given good accounts of their worth",

It is also practised a little in Limerick, but I\nhave never heard of it being played in Waterford or Tipperary.\nast year I was much interested to hear of a game known as\n“pullet ”. throwing being played in certain parts of County Louth,\nand, being curious to see the game, I paid a visit to’ a locality\nwhere I was promised an opportunity of witnessing it. On my\narrival here I was much surprised to find some young lads casting\nbowls along the road. ‘They had no idea of the game as known\nin Munster, but were simply throwing the “bullets” from one\nto another. Needless to say, for old times sake, I indulged in\nthe luxury of a few casts. ‘ .",
